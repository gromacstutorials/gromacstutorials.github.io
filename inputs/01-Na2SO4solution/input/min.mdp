ns_type = grid

;======================== output ============== ; description
nstlog = 10 ; number of steps that elapse between writing energies to the log file
nstenergy = 10 ; number of steps that elapse between writing energies to energy file
nstxout = 10 ; frequency to write coordinates to xtc trajectory

;======================== van der Waals ======= ; description
vdw-type = Cut-off ; plain cut-off with rlist >= rvdw
rvdw = 1.0 ; distance for the LJ cut-off (nm)

; ======================= electrostatics ======= ; description
coulombtype = pme ; fast smooth Particle-Mesh Ewald (SPME) electrostatics
fourierspacing = 0.1 ; this should give an accuracy of about 2-3*10^-4
