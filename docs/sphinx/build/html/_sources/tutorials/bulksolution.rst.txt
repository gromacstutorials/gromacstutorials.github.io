Bulk salt solution
******************

.. container:: hatnote

    The very basics of GROMACS through a
    simple example: a bulk solution of
    SO\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`2-` and Na\ :sup:`+`.

    **The objective of this tutorial** is to use the
    open-source code GROMACS to perform a simple molecular
    dynamics simulation: a liquid solution of water mixed
    with sodium (Na\ :sup:`+`) and sulfate
    (SO\ :sub:`4`\ :sup:`2-`) ions. This tutorial
    illustrates several major ingredients of molecular
    dynamics simulations, such as energy minimization,
    thermostating, NVT and NPT equilibration, and
    trajectory visualisation.

    There are **no prerequisite** to follow this tutorial,
    but your life will be easier if you are familiar with
    using the terminal.

Required softwares
==================

..  container:: justify

    GROMACS must be installed on your machine. You can
    install it following the instructions of the `GROMACS
    website <https://manual.gromacs.org/current/index.html>`__.
    Alternatively, if you are using Ubuntu OS, you can
    simply execute the following command in a terminal:

..  code-block:: bw

    sudo apt-get install gromacs
   
..  container:: justify

    You can verify that GROMACS is indeed installed on your
    computer by typing in a terminal :

..  code-block:: bw

    gmx

..  container:: justify

    You should see the version of GROMACS that has been
    installed. On my computer I see

..  code-block:: bw

    :-) GROMACS - gmx, 2023 (-:

as well as a quote (at the bottom), such as

..  code-block:: bw

    GROMACS reminds you: "Computers are like humans - they do everything except think." (John von Neumann)

..  container:: justify

    In addition to GROMACS, you will also need |(1) a basic text editing software|
    such as Vim, Gedit, or Notepad++, |(2) a visualization software|, here I
    will use VMD (note: VMD is free but you have to register to
    the uiuc website in order to download it. If you don't want
    to, you can also use Ovito.), |(3) a plotting tool| like
    XmGrace or pyplot.

The input files
===============

..  container:: justify

    In order to run the present simulation using GROMACS,
    we need the 3 following files:

    - 1) a **configuration file** (.gro) containing the
         initial positions of the atoms and the box
         dimensions,
    - 2) a **topology file** (.top) containing
         information about the force field (e.g. interaction
         parameters, molecular constraints),
    - 3) and an **input file** (.mdp) containing the
         parameters of the simulation (e.g. temperature,
         timestep).
