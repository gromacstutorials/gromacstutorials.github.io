  abstract = {A potential model intended to be a general purpose model for the condensed phases of water is presented. TIP4P/2005 is a rigid four site model which consists of three fixed point charges and one Lennard-Jones center. The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123to573K and pressures up to 40000bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions. For example, it gives excellent predictions for the densities at 1bar with a maximum density at 278K and an averaged difference with experiment of 7{\texttimes}10-4g/cm3.},

Neutron diffraction experiments with selective isotopic compositions have been performed to vary systematically the scattering length density and thus to highlight different mixture components. The observed apparently anomalous variation of the intensity of the Bragg peaks of the MCM-41 after filling demonstrates without further analysis that the liquid mixture must be inhomogeneous at the nanoscale. Our experimental observations can be rationalized when comparing with the predictions of simple core-shell models. Within this core- shell model, we deduce that tert-butanol segregates as a pore surface layer of about one atomic size surrounding a toluene-rich core of two to three atomic layers.},

Especially, silica membranes have been studied in great depth. Steps towards hybrid organosilica membranes were taken by using pendant organic groups. However, only with the appearance of organically bridged silica, stable and reliable membranes that are suitable for large scale industrial utilization have become available. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent development of hybrid silica membranes that contain organic bridges. The freedom of choice in precursor allows for a flexible approach towards tailoring of the membrane properties. New support materials can be used by applying alternative deposition methods, such as expanding thermal plasma chemical vapor deposition. The robustness of the membrane concept allows for the design of novel separation process concepts in which the demonstrated stability is required.},

Entrance effects are shown to dominate the dynamics of the peeling front.           ,              Combining molecular dynamics (MD) and continuum simulations, we study the dynamics of propagation of a peeling front in a system composed of multilayered graphene nanosheets completely immersed in water. Peeling is induced by lifting one of the nanosheet edges with an assigned pulling velocity normal to the flat substrate. Using MD, we compute the pulling force as a function of the pulling velocity, and quantify the viscous resistance to the advancement of the peeling front. We compare the MD results to a 1D continuum model of a sheet loaded with modelled hydrodynamic loads. Our results show that the viscous dependence of the force on the velocity is negligible below a threshold velocity. Above this threshold, the hydrodynamics is mainly controlled by the viscous resistance associated to the flow near the crack opening, while lubrication forces are negligible owing to the large hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid boundary. Two dissipative mechanisms are identified: a drag resistance to the upward motion of the edge, and a resistance to the gap opening associated to the curvature of the flow streamlines near the entrance. Surprisingly, the shape of the sheet was found to be approximately independent of the pulling velocity even for the largest velocities considered.},

Their distinctive properties linked to their (sub)nanometer size and hydrophobicity allow for water intrusion only under high hydrostatic pressure. Here we focus on the popular ZIF-8 material investigating the intrusion mechanism in its nanoscale cages, which is the key to its rational exploitation in target applications. In this work, we used a joint experimental/theoretical approach combining in operando synchrotron experiments during highpressure intrusion experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and stochastic models to reveal that water intrusion into ZIF-8 occurs by a cascade filling of connected cages rather than a condensation process as previously assumed. The reported results allowed us to establish structure/function relations in this prototypical microporous material, representing an important step to devise design rules to synthesize porous media.},

The ligand dipole moment could be considered as one of the main criteria for CO2 adsorption enhancement. To verify this hypothesis, an experimental--computational study was performed on an isoreticular ZIF series with sodalite (SOD) topology using published structures (ZIF-8, ZIF-90, and ZIF-Cl) as well as hypothetical structures (ZIF-COOH and ZIF-NO2) designated using DFT calculations. An analysis of structural and adsorptive properties was proposed for these materials used to separate CO2 from CH4, CO, or N2 gas. The accuracy of the calculated results was validated by comparison with our own experimental results. An exponential relationship between the ligand dipole moments and the isosteric heat of adsorption of CO2 was highlighted. Modifying the nature of the linker (dipole moment) allows a 5- to 7-fold improvement in CO2 selectivity for CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/CO mixtures.},

The algorithm is similar to SHAKE, which is one of the standard methods for performing such calculations. RATTLE calculates the positions and velocities at the next time from the positions and velocities at the present time step, without requiring information about the earlier history. Like SHAKE, it is based on the Verlet algorithm and retains the simplicity of using Cartesian coordinates for each of the atoms to describe the configuration of a molecule with internal constraints. RATTLE guarantees that the coordinates and velocities of the atoms in a molecule satisfy the internal constraints at each time step. RATTLE has two advantages over SHAKE. On computers of fixed precision, it is of higher precision than SHAKE. Since it deals directly with the velocities, it is easier to modify RATTLE for use with the recently developed constant temperature and constant pressure molecular dynamics methods and with the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods that make use of rescaling of the atomic velocities.},

The characteristic ratio of PEO chains in the melt as obtained from simulations compared well with the values from SANS experiments. Detailed analysis of the MD trajectories revealed a broad distribution in the number of ether oxygen atoms per 12 repeat unit chain involved in Li+ cation complexation, with a strong preference for zero, three, and six ether oxygen atoms per chain. Chains not directly involved in cation complexation (zero complexing ether oxygen atoms) were found to have chain dimensions similar to those in the pure melt. Chains with one to three ether oxygen atoms involved in cation complexation actually showed an increase in radius of gyration. Chains with four or more ether oxygen atoms involved in cation complexation showed increasingly narrow radius of gyration distributions and decreasing radius of gyration, reflecting tight wrapping of the chains around the Li+ cations.},

  abstract = {This comprehensive study explored the aging process of PIM-1, a ladder polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM), by applying molecular dynamics simulations for the first time. Through detailed analysis, our work illustrates the evolution of the polymer structure from a loosely packed, less dense state of the pristine polymer to a more tightly packed configuration due to physical aging. For this purpose, a novel molecular dynamics (MD) methodology was employed in the process toward equilibration of PIM-1. This structural transition was quantitatively captured by measuring key parameters such as density, fractional free volume (FFV), cohesive energy density (CED), d-spacing, surface area, and gas permeabilities. The simulations demonstrate a noticeable increase in density by approximately 7 \% in aged PIM-1 compared to a fresh sample. This increase in density is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in FFV, suggesting a more compact molecular arrangement. The impact of these structural changes is evident in the gas transport properties. Permeabilities of all gases tested, He, H2, O2, N2, CO2 and CH4, decreased by 33 \%--80 \%. Moreover, the selectivity of gas pairs like CO2/CH4 and O2/N2 exhibited increasing trends due to aging, as previously reported in experimental work. Structural analysis performed on the fresh and aged structures indicated collapse of free volume over aging, by disappearance of pores larger than {\textasciitilde}6.5 {\AA}. Furthermore, no intrachain rearrangement was observed during physical aging in the ladder PIM-1 structure; rather, the aging resulted in increased interchain packing efficiency. Our methodology can be employed to other PIM architectures, such as polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-PIs) as well as low-free volume glassy polymers.},

  abstract = {Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/ SANS) provide valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of biomolecules in solution, complementing a wide range of structural techniques, including molecular dynamics simulations. As contrastbased methods, they are sensitive not only to structural properties but also to solvent-solute interactions. Their use in molecular dynamics simulations requires a forward model that should be as fast and accurate as possible. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of calculating SAXS and SANS intensities using a coarsegrained representation consisting of one bead per amino acid and three beads per nucleic acid, with form factors that can be corrected on the fly to account for solvation effects at no additional computational cost. By coupling this forward model with molecular dynamics simulations restrained with SAS data, it is possible to determine conformational ensembles or refine the structure and dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids in agreement with the experimental results. To assess the robustness of this approach, we applied it to gelsolin, for which we acquired SAXS data on its closed state, and to a UP1-microRNA complex, for which we used previously collected measurements. Our hybrid-resolution small-angle scattering (hySAS) implementation, being distributed in PLUMED, can be used with atomistic and coarse-grained simulations using diverse restraining strategies.},

  abstract = {We introduce a regularization procedure to define electrostatic energies and forces in a slab system of thickness h that is periodic in two dimensions and carries a net charge. The regularization corresponds to a neutralization of the system by two charged walls and can be viewed as the extension to the two-dimensional (2D)+h geometry of the neutralization by a homogeneous background in the standard three-dimensional Ewald method. The energies and forces can be computed efficiently by using advanced methods for systems with 2D periodicity, such as MMM2D or P3M/ELC, or by introducing a simple background-charge correction to the Yeh--Berkowitz approach of slab systems. The results are checked against direct lattice sum calculations on simple systems. We show, in particular, that the Madelung energy of a 2D square charge lattice in a uniform compensating background is correctly reproduced to high accuracy. A molecular dynamics simulation of a sodium ion close to an air/water interface is performed to demonstrate that the method does indeed provide consistent long-range electrostatics. The mean force on the ion reduces at large distances to the image-charge interaction predicted by macroscopic electrostatics. This result is used to determine precisely the position of the macroscopic dielectric interface with respect to the true molecular surface.},

  abstract = {The effect of confinement between mica and graphene on the structure and dynamics of alcohol-water mixtures has been studied in situ and in real time at the molecular level by atomic force microscopy (AFM) at room temperature. AFM images reveal that the adsorbed molecules are segregated into faceted alcohol-rich islands on top of an ice layer on mica, surrounded by a pre-existing multilayer water-rich film. These faceted islands are in direct contact with the graphene surface, revealing a preferred adsorption site. Moreover, alcohol adsorption at low relative humidity (RH) reveals a strong preference of the alcohol molecules for the ordered ice interface. The growth dynamics of the alcohol islands is governed by supersaturation, temperature, the free energy of attachment of molecules to the island edge and two-dimensional (2D) diffusion. The measured diffusion coefficients display a size dependence on the molecular size of the alcohols, and are about 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk diffusion coefficients, demonstrating the effect of confinement on the behavior of the alcohols. These experimental results provide new insights into the behavior of multicomponent fluids in confined geometries, which is of paramount importance in nanofluidics and biology.},

In the previous simulation, the interaction between a single gold atom tip and a SAM sample consisting of the united atoms (CH3) with a mass (m0) and a continuum gold substrate was treated explicitly in terms of microscopic potentials. On the other hand, the probe tip with an artificial reduced mass (msl) was bound to a cantilever spring in order to describe its macroscopic nc-AFM behaviour. In the present study, we treated explicitly the interaction between a gold probe tip (the radius = R) having a single gold atom at the apex and the same SAM on gold. By using this new MD method, we succeeded in interpreting our recent experimental nc-AFM observation. Namely, the local atom--atom interactions in terms of Lennard-Jones potentials together with the long-range sphere--substrate interaction are responsible for inversion and molecular-dependent imaging of van der Waals (i.e. chemically inert) molecules bound on gold substrates.},

The 1H NMR spin-lattice relaxation rates R1({$\omega$}) probed in the FC measurements for different isotope-labelled compounds are computed from the MD trajectories for broad frequency and temperature ranges. We find high correspondence between experiment and simulation. Concerning the rotational motion, we observe that the aliphatic and hydroxyl groups show similar correlation times but different stretching parameters, while the overall reorientation associated with the structural relaxation remains largely isotropic. Additional analysis of the simulation results reveals that transitions between different molecular configurations are slow on the time scale of the structural relaxation at least at sufficiently high temperatures, indicating that glycerol rotates at a rigid entity, but the reorientation is slower for elongated than for compact conformers. The translational contribution to R1({$\omega$}) is well described by the force-free hard sphere model. At sufficiently low frequencies, universal square-root laws provide access to the molecular diffusion coefficients. In both experiment and simulation, the time scales of the rotational and translational motions show an unusually large separation, which is at variance with the Stokes--Einstein--Debye relation. To further explore this effect, we investigate the structure and dynamics on various length scales in the simulations. We observe that a prepeak in the static structure factor S(q), which is related to a local segregation of aliphatic and hydroxyl groups, is accompanied by a peak in the correlation times {$\tau$}(q) from coherent scattering functions.},

  abstract = {After 70 years, modern pressure-driven polymer membrane processes with liquids are mature and accepted in many industries due to their good performance, ease of scale-up, low energy consumption, modular compact construction, and low operating costs compared with thermal systems. Successful isothermal operation of synthetic membranes with liquids requires consideration of three critical aspects or ``legs'' in order of relevance: selectivity, capacity (i.e. permeation flow rate per unit area) and transport of mass and momentum comprising concentration polarization (CP) and fouling (F). Major challenges remain with respect to increasing selectivity and controlling mass transport in, to and away from membranes. Thus, prediction and control of membrane morphology and a deep understanding of the mechanism of dissolved and suspended solute transport near and in the membrane (i.e. diffusional and convective mass transport) is essential. Here, we focus on materials development to address the relatively poor selectivity of liquid membrane filtration with polymers and discuss the critical aspects of transport limitations. Machine learning could help optimize membrane structure design and transport conditions for improved membrane filtration performance.},

In this paper, we introduce stochastic cell rescaling, a first-order barostat that samples the correct volume fluctuations by including a suitable noise term. The algorithm is shown to report volume fluctuations compatible with the isobaric ensemble and its anisotropic variant is tested on a membrane simulation. Stochastic cell rescaling can be straightforwardly implemented in the existing codes and can be used effectively in both equilibration and production phases.},

  abstract = {The adsorption of carbon dioxide, methane, and their mixtures in nanoporous carbons in the presence of water is studied using experiments and molecular simulations. Both the experimental and numerical samples contain polar groups that account for their partially hydrophilicity. For small amounts of adsorbed water, although the shape of the adsorption isotherms remain similar, both the molecular simulations and experiments show a slight decrease in the CO2 and CH4 adsorption amounts. For large amounts of adsorbed water, the experimental data suggest the formation of methane or carbon dioxide clathrates in agreement with previous work. In contrast, the molecular simulations do not account for the formation of such clathrates. Another important difference between the simulated and experimental data concerns the number of water molecules that desorb upon increasing the pressure of carbon dioxide and methane. Although the experimental data indicate that water remains adsorbed upon carbon dioxide and methane adsorption, the molecular simulations suggest that 40 to 75\% of the initial amount of adsorbed water desorbs with carbon dioxide or methane pressure. Such discrepancies show that differences between the simulated and experimental samples are crucial to account for the rich phase behavior of confined water-gas systems. Our simulations for carbon dioxide-methane coadsorption in the presence of water suggest that the pore filling is not affected by the presence of water and that adsorbed solution theory can be applied for pressures as high as 15 MPa.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo simulation and theory are used to calculate the excess thermodynamic properties of binary mixtures of spherical Lennard-Jones molecules. We study the excess functions of three binary mixtures characterized by the following size and dispersive energy ratios: (1) ({$\sigma$}22/{$\sigma$}11)3 = 2 and ∊22/∊11 = 2; (2) ({$\sigma$}22/{$\sigma$}11)3 = 1 and ∊22/∊11 = 1/2 and (3) ({$\sigma$}22/{$\sigma$}11)3 = 1/2 and ∊22/∊11 = 2. In all cases, the unlike size parameter, {$\sigma$}12, is kept constant and equal to the value given by the Lorentz combining rule ({$\sigma$}12 = ({$\sigma$}11 + {$\sigma$}22)/2). However, different unlike dispersive energy parameter values are considered through the following combining rules: (a) ∊12 = (∊11∊22)1/2 (Berthelot rule); (b) ∊12 = ∊11 (association); and (c) ∊12 = ∊22 (solvation). The pressure and temperature dependence of the excess volume and excess enthalpy is studied using the NpT Monte Carlo simulation technique for all the systems considered. Additionally, the simplest conformal solution theory is used to check the adequacy of this approach in predicting the excess properties in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions and variety of binary mixtures. In particular, we have applied the van der Waals one-fluid theory to describe Lennard-Jones binary mixtures through the use of the Johnson et al. [1993, Molec. Phys., 78, 591] Helmholtz free energy. Agreement between simulation results and theoretical predictions is excellent in all cases and thermodynamic conditions considered. This work confirms the applicability of the van der Waals one-fluid theory in predicting excess thermodynamic properties of mixtures of spherical molecules. Furthermore, since binary mixtures of spherical Lennard-Jones molecules constitute the reference fluid to be used in perturbation theories for complex fluids, such as the statistical association fluid theory (SAFT), this work shows clearly the applicability of the conformal solution theory within the framework of SAFT for predicting excess functions.},

We perform coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of ionomer melts to understand cation mobility as a function of polymer architecture, background relative permittivity, and corresponding ionic aggregate morphology. In systems exhibiting percolated ionic aggregates, cations diffuse via stepping motions along the ionic aggregates. These diffusivities can be quantitatively predicted by calculating the lifetimes of continuous association between oppositely charged ions, which equal the time scales of the stepping (diffusive) motions. In contrast, predicting cation diffusivity for systems with isolated ionic aggregates requires another time scale. Our results suggest that to improve conductivity the Coulombic interaction strength should be strong enough to favor percolated aggregates but weak enough to facilitate ion dissociation.},

Effects of the inhomogeneity length scale are systematically considered via the imposition of sinusoidal density profiles of various wavelengths. For long-wavelength density profiles, bulk-like relationships between local structure, thermodynamics, and diffusivity are observed as expected. However, for both systems, a crossover in behavior occurs as a function of wavelength, with qualitatively different correlations between the local static and dynamic quantities emerging as density variations approach the scale of a particle diameter. Irrespective of the density variation wavelength, average diffusivities of hard-sphere fluids in the inhomogeneous and homogeneous directions are coupled and approximately correlate with the volume available for insertion of another particle. Unfortunately, a quantitatively reliable static predictor of position-dependent dynamics has yet to be identified for even the simplest of inhomogeneous fluids.},

The adsorption isotherms for water in these nanopores resemble those observed for experimental samples; the adsorbed amount increases continuously in the multilayer adsorption regime until a jump occurs due to capillary condensation of the fluid within the pore. Strong layering of water in the vicinity of the silica surfaces is observed as marked density oscillations are observed up to 8 A{\r{}} from the surface in the density profiles for confined water. Our results indicate that water molecules within the first adsorbed layer tend to adopt a H-down orientation with respect to the silica substrate. For all pore sizes and adsorbed amounts, the self-diffusivity of confined water is lower than the bulk, due to the hydrophilic interaction between the water molecules and the hydroxylated silica surface. Our results also suggest that the self-diffusivity of confined water is sensitive to the adsorbed amount.},

At high water contents the spectrum is a superposition of a narrow central component and a quadrupole doublet. The quadrupole splitting and the relaxation rates of both components, monitored as a function of water content and temperature, are discussed in terms of models for the water-protein interaction. The anisotropy of the water molecule motion is clearly demonstrated by the deuterium quadrupole splitting observed in the protein single crystal, but such splittings were not found in protein powders and frozen protein solutions. We therefore suggest that the most useful view of such data is to consider the water-protein interactions at the surface to be mixed rapidly and that a distribution of interactions be invoked rather than an oversimplified view often taken of a two or n-site mixing where n is small.},

One of their major drawbacks is low gas selectivity. In this study, thin film composite (TFC) membranes have been developed with high CO2 permeance and superior CO2/N2 selectivity due to a strong synergistic effect. The TFC membranes, comprising a thin layer (0.29-0.42 m) of PIM-1 atop a cross-linked PTMSP gutter layer (2.07-3.44 m) on a porous backing material, were fabricated by coating PIM-1 solution on the cross-linked PTMSP support. A key element is that for coating PIM-1 a mixed solvent of chloroform and trichloroethylene (1:1) was successfully implemented for the first time. All membrane samples demonstrated a strong synergistic enhancement of CO2/N2 selectivity (=35.8-55.7) compared to PIM-1 (=18.5) and cross-linked PTMSP (=3.7). SEM, TEM and laser interferometry studies revealed that the synergistic enhancement of gas selectivity in the TFC membranes is most likely due to the creation of a very thin boundary layer between PIM-1 and the cross-linked PTMSP gutter layer. The aged TFC membranes (after three months) showed a severe drop in gas permeance while keeping nearly the same high selectivity. Thus, future success in the prevention of polymer physical aging, together with the synergy effect in selectivity reported for the first time in this work, will give new opportunities for application of polymers of intrinsic microporosity.},

MD simulations using a quantum-chemistrybased many-body polarizable force field yielded ion self-diffusion coefficients, electrolyte conductivity, ion aggregation, and the coordination environment of Li+ in good agreement with experiment. Lithium transport was found to arise from a combination of the subdiffusive Li+ motion along PEO chains, motion together with PEO segments and intersegmental Li+ hops from one PEO segment to another. The rate of intersegmental hops was found to correlate well with times at which Li+ motion crosses over from subdiffusive to diffusive behavior. The contribution of Li+ motion along PEO chains to the total Li+ transport was found to be approximately equal to the contribution from Li+ moving together with PEO segments. Diffusion of both Li+ and TFSI- was found to be strongly coupled to PEO ether oxygen atom displacements and PEO conformational dynamics.},

The unique diffusion mechanisms in such solids stem from restricted pore relocation and ill-defined surface boundaries. While diffusion fundamentals in simple geometries are well-established, fluids in complex materials challenge existing frameworks. Here, we invoke the intermittent surface/pore diffusion formalism to map molecular dynamics onto random walk in disordered media. Our hierarchical strategy allows bridging microscopic/mesoscopic dynamics with parameters obtained from simple laws. The residence and relocation times -- tA, tB -- are shown to derive from pore size d and temperature-rescaled surface interaction {$\varepsilon$}/kBT. tA obeys a transition state theory with a barrier\,{\textasciitilde}{$\varepsilon$}/kBT and a prefactor\,{\textasciitilde}10-12 s corrected for pore diameter d. tB scales with d which is rationalized through a cutoff in the relocation first passage distribution. This approach provides a formalism to predict any fluid diffusion in complex media using parameters available to simple experiments.},

We report here molecular dynamics-based characterization of structures and diffusion in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with lithium and bis(trifluoromethysulfonyl)imide (TFSI) ions imbedded into the PEO structure. We consider a range of temperatures (360-480 K), molecular weights (43, 22, 10, and 2 chains with 23, 45, 100, and 450 EO monomers, respectively), and ion concentrations (r = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08 Li:EO) for which there is experimental data. The found dependence of the diffusion coefficients on these variables is in good agreement with experimental measurements. We then analyze how the diffusion performance depends on details of the atomistic diffusion mechanism, the motion of the Li and TFSI along the polymer chains and hopping between them, the role of polymer motion, the temperature dependence of the intrachain and interchain diffusion contributions to the total ionic diffusion coefficients, and how these depend on ionic concentration and molecular weight. The most diffusive Li atoms exhibit frequent interchain hopping, whereas the least diffusive Li atoms oscillate or ``shift'' between two or more polymer chains. These shifts may affect the segmental motion of the PEO-LiTFSI polymer that is expected to be important for fast lithium-ion diffusion. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory validates the approach and methodology used in this study, setting the stage for applying this methodology to predicting how to modify the polymer structure to increase ionic conductivity for a new generation of electrochemical materials.},

Examples include substituted polyacetylenes, perfluoropolymers, addition-type polynorbornene, polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) and some polyimides. High permeability membranes may also be produced by thermal rearrangement of precursor polymers.},

In this approach the velocities of all the particles are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling. The authors illustrate the properties of this new method on Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its performance is excellent and largely independent of the thermostat parameter also with regard to the dynamic properties.},

Consistency is found between self-diffusion coefficients (Ds) obtained separately by proton and deuterium observation in a common molecular species, d1-benzene, and the semiclassical Stejskal--Tanner relation is verified to high precision for j=1/2 and j=1. The influence of rf field inhomogeneity on PFGNMR is examined for j=1/2 and j=1 in theory and experiment and we show that an rf offset angle {$\Delta\Theta$} leads to a zero gradient intercept which depends on cos3 {$\Delta\Theta$}. We obtain the temperature dependence of Ds for D2O and also find the separate proton and deuteron Ds values over the entire mole-ratio range in D2O/H2O mixtures. It is shown theoretically that the presence of rank 2 tensor interactions in the nuclear spin Hamiltonian does not disturb the PFGNMR experiment performed using the solid-echo rf sequence except to introduce a zero gradient intercept. We report the first solid-echo PFGNMR experiment performed on deuterium in the presence of nonzero static quadrupolar interactions. Using the liquid crystal system K-palmitate/D2O we examine the diffusion anisotropy and orientational symmetry in both oriented single crystal and randomly oriented polycrystal samples. Finally we exploit deuterium labeling to obtain the diffusion coefficient of adrenalin in human blood plasma by deuterium PFGNMR.},

The Electric Field Gradient (EFG) is the key microscopic quantity to understand the NMR relaxation of quadrupolar ions, such as 7Li+, 23Na+, 25Mg2+, 35Cl-, 39K+, or 133Cs+. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the statistical and dynamical properties of the EFG experienced by alkaline, alkaline Earth, and chloride ions at infinite dilution in water. Specifically, we analyze the effect of the ionic charge and size on the distribution of the EFG tensor and on the multi-step decay of its auto-correlation function. The main contribution to the NMR relaxation time arises from the slowest mode, with a characteristic time on the picosecond time scale. The first solvation shell of the ion plays a dominant role in the fluctuations of the EFG, all the more that the ion radius is small and its charge is large. We propose an analysis based on a simplified charge distribution around the ion, which demonstrates that the auto-correlation of the EFG, hence the NMR relaxation time, reflects primarily the collective translational motion of water molecules in the first solvation shell of the cations. Our findings provide a microscopic route to the quantitative interpretation of NMR relaxation measurements and open the way to the design of improved analytical theories for NMR relaxation for small ionic solutes, which should focus on water density fluctuations around the ion.},

This review highlights the recent significant developments in the experiment, theory, and simulation of nuclear quantum effects in water. Novel experimental techniques, such as deep inelastic neutron scattering, now provide a detailed view of the role of nuclear quantum effects in water's properties. These have been combined with theoretical developments such as the introduction of the principle of competing quantum effects that allows the subtle interplay of water's quantum effects and their manifestation in experimental observables to be explained. We discuss how this principle has recently been used to explain the apparent dichotomy in water's isotope effects, which can range from very large to almost nonexistent depending on the property and conditions. We then review the latest major developments in simulation algorithms and theory that have enabled the efficient inclusion of nuclear quantum effects in molecular simulations, permitting their combination with on-the-fly evaluation of the potential energy surface using electronic structure theory. Finally, we identify current challenges and future opportunities in this area of research.},

The transport mechanism in certain classes of membranes is well understood. It is generally believed that polymeric membranes used in gas separation follow the solution--diffusion model. However, the transport mechanism in other membranes such as the ones used in water desalination is less clear as both the solution--diffusion and hydrodynamic models have been proposed. In this contribution, we study the structure as well as the water and polymer dynamics of several polymeric membranes using small-angle and quasi-elastic neutron scattering. We demonstrate that on the scale of a few nanometers, water appears to diffuse through a desalination membrane at a rate comparable to bulk water, while water diffuses at a rate that is a factor of 2 slower in an anion-exchange membrane. These results illustrate the importance of studying both the structure and dynamics of membrane materials and have important implications in understanding the transport mechanisms that differentiate the different types of polymeric membranes.},

The assembly of all cell insides and cell walls are termed symplast and apoplast, respectively. Water transport is pressure driven in both, where osmosis plays an essential role in membrane crossing. In this paper, a microscopic model of water flow and transport of an osmotically active solute in a plant tissue is considered. The model is posed on the scale of a single cell and the tissue is assumed to be composed of periodically distributed cells. The flow in the symplast can be regarded as a viscous Stokes flow, while Darcy's law applies in the porous apoplast. Transmission conditions at the interface (semipermeable membrane) are obtained by balancing the mass fluxes through the interface and by describing the protein mediated transport as a surface reaction. Applying homogenization techniques, macroscopic equations for water and solute transport in a plant tissue are derived. The macroscopic problem is given by a Darcy law with a force term proportional to the difference in concentrations of the osmotically active solute in the symplast and apoplast; i.e. the flow is also driven by the local concentration difference and its direction can be different than the one prescribed by the pressure gradient.},

Here we find that the originally reported CALF-20 phase (now denoted {$\alpha$}CALF-20) undergoes a structure transformation following exposure to humid environments to generate a new polymorph, {$\beta$}-CALF-20, identified here through combined synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. This {$\alpha$}-to-{$\beta$} transformation is fully reversible with {$\alpha$}CALF-20 being regenerated by treating {$\beta$}-CALF-20 under dry air or vacuum. The rapid reversion of {$\beta$}- to {$\alpha$}-CALF-20 under conditions relevant to measuring the gas adsorption isotherm required the CO2 adsorption properties for {$\beta$}-CALF-20 to be evaluated computationally. Experimental evaluation of the adsorption behavior of {$\beta$}-CALF-20 is not practical. These analyses suggest that {$\beta$}-CALF-20 has a higher CO2 heat of adsorption than {$\alpha$}-CALF-20, which may be advantageous to CO2 sorption selectivity at low partial pressures.},

Different hydrogen bond networks are examined; cellulose swells to form water--cellulose bonds upon adsorption but these bonds do not break upon desorption at the same chemical potential. These findings, which are supported by mechanical testing and cellulose textural assessment upon sorption, shed light on experimental observations for wood and other related materials.},

The desolvation barrier is dominated by the unfavorable enthalpic contribution in spite of a fairly large favorable entropic compensation. The enthalpic contributions, incorporating the Lennard-Jones solute-solvent terms, largely determine the stability of the solvent separated configuration. We decompose the enthalpy into a direct solute-solute term, the solute-solvent interactions and the remainder that contains pressure-volume work as well as contributions due to solvent reorganization. The enthalpic contribution due to changes in water-water interactions arising from solvent reorganization around the solute molecules is shown to have major contribution in the solvent induced enthalpy change.},

  abstract = {The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation of quadrupolar nuclei is governed by the electric field gradient (EFG) fluctuations at their position. In classical molecular dynamics (MD), the electron cloud contribution to the EFG can be included via the Sternheimer approximation, in which the full EFG at the nucleus that can be computed using quantum density functional theory (DFT) is considered to be proportional to that arising from the external, classical charge distribution. In this work, we systematically assess the quality of the Sternheimer approximation as well as the impact of the classical force field (FF) on the NMR relaxation rates of aqueous quadrupolar ions at infinite dilution. In particular, we compare the rates obtained using an ab initio parametrized polarizable FF, a recently developed empirical FF with scaled ionic charges and a simple empirical nonpolarizable FF with formal ionic charges. Surprisingly, all three FFs considered yield good values for the rates of smaller and less polarizable solutes (Li+, Na+, K+, Cl-), provided that a model-specific Sternheimer parametrization is employed. Yet, the polarizable and scaled charge FFs yield better estimates for divalent and more polarizable species (Mg2+, Ca2+, Cs+). We find that a linear relationship between the quantum and classical EFGs holds well in all of the cases considered; however, such an approximation often leads to quite large errors in the resulting EFG variance, which is directly proportional to the computed rate. We attempted to reduce the errors by including first order nonlinear corrections to the EFG, yet no clear improvement for the resulting variance has been found. The latter result indicates that more refined methods for determining the EFG at the ion position, in particular those that take into account the instantaneous atomic environment around an ion, might be necessary to systematically improve the NMR relaxation rate estimates in classical MD.},

Yet, obtaining links to molecular motion is challenging for many ions that relax through the quadrupolar mechanism, which is mediated by electric field gradient fluctuations and lacks a detailed microscopic description. For sodium ions in aqueous electrolytes, we combine ab initio calculations to account for electron cloud effects with classical molecular dynamics to sample long-time fluctuations, and obtain relaxation rates in good agreement with experiments over broad concentration and temperature ranges. We demonstrate that quadrupolar nuclear relaxation is sensitive to subpicosecond dynamics not captured by previous models based on water reorientation or cluster rotation. While ions affect the overall water retardation, experimental trends are mainly explained by dynamics in the first two solvation shells of sodium, which contain mostly water. This work thus paves the way to the quantitative understanding of quadrupolar relaxation in electrolyte and bioelectrolyte systems.},

In the metastable liquid region, theory has hypothesized the existence of a liquid-liquid critical point from which a dividing line separates two water species of high and low density. A recent small-angle X-ray scattering study has claimed that the two structural species postulated in the supercooled state are seen to exist in bulk water at ambient conditions. We analyze new small-angle X-ray scattering data on ambient liquid water taken at third generation synchrotron sources, and large 32,000 water molecule simulations using the TIP4P-Ew model of water, to show that the small-angle region measures standard number density fluctuations consistent with water's isothermal compressibility temperature trends. Our study shows that there is no support or need for heterogeneities in water structure at room temperature to explain the small-angle scattering data, as it is consistent with a unimodal density of the tetrahedral liquid at ambient conditions.},

Its adsorption isotherms have inflection points and breakthrough curves obtained in dynamic column separation experiments exhibit stepped profiles. With the aim to optimize this adsorptive alcohol recovery process using ZIF-8, the correlation between the shape of the adsorption isotherms and the breakthrough curves was further explored in this work by means of liquid phase batch measurements and breakthrough experiments, with diluted ethanol/water mixtures. The shape of the concentration profiles, in adsorption mode as well in desorption mode, have been carefully analyzed making use of simple theoretical tools, including an axial dispersion model and a wave theory based approach. It was shown that, as a direct expression of the adsorption isotherm and the feed concentration, the concentration profiles were composed of different ``shock waves'' and ``dispersive waves'' propagating at different velocities along the column length. The description of the breakthrough and desorption curves in terms of propagation velocities enabled to gain insights into the fundamental role of the adsorption isotherm into the characteristics and the formation of the concentration profiles. The concept of ``fractional used bed capacity'' (FUBC) was introduced to illustrate the effect of the adsorption isotherm shape on the dynamic capacity at breakthrough point. According to the shape of the adsorption isotherm, efficient desorption could be achieved with the ZIF-8 material. This work provides, with limited computational effort, new perspectives for the further development and optimization of adsorptive separation processes with MOF materials, such as the recovery of bio-alcohols from aqueous mixtures with the ZIF-8 adsorbent.},

  abstract = {In combination with other spectroscopy, microscopy, and scattering techniques, neutron reflectivity is a powerful tool to characterize biological systems. Specular reflection of neutrons provides structural information at the nanometer and subnanometer length scales, probing the composition and organization of layered materials. Currently, analysis of neutron reflectivity data involves several simplifying assumptions about the structure of the sample under study, affecting the extraction and interpretation of information from the experimental data. Computer simulations can be used as a source of structural and dynamic data with atomic resolution. We present a novel tool to compare the structural properties determined by neutron reflectivity experiments with those obtained from molecular simulations. This tool allows benchmarking the ability of molecular dynamics simulations to reproduce experimental data, but it also promotes unbiased interpretation of experimentally determined quantities. Two application examples are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the new tool. The first example is the generation of reflectivity profiles for a 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) lipid bilayer from molecular dynamics simulations using data from both atomistic and coarse-grained models, and comparison with experimentally measured data. The second example is the calculation of lipid volume changes with temperature and composition from all atoms simulations of single and mixed 1,2-di-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dihexadecanoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) bilayers.},

  abstract = {Alkanes are a fundamental part in empirical force fields (FF) not only due to their technological relevance, but also due to the prevalence of alkane moieties in organic molecules, e.g., compounds containing a saturated carbon chain. Therefore, a good description of alkane interactions is crucial for determining the quality of a FF. In this study, the performance of 12 empirical force fields (FF) was evaluated in the context of reproducing liquid properties of alkanes. More specifically, n-octane was chosen as a reference compound since it is a liquid in a broad temperature range and it has numerous experimental data for thermodynamic, transport, and structural properties, as well as for their temperature dependencies. A normalized root-meansquare deviation (NRMSD) analysis was used to rank the force fields in their ability to reproduce the experimental data. Five out of the six best force fields considered were united-atom models. The GROMOS force field showed the smallest deviation in terms of NRMSD, followed by TRAPPE-EH, NERD, CHARMM-UA, TRAPPE-UA, and OPLS-UA. This overall better performance of the united-atom force fields indicates that complexity does not always bring quality.},

The major feature is that the spatial white noise for this system appears not additively but multiplicatively. This simply expresses the fact that the density cannot fluctuate in regions devoid of particles. The steady state for the density function may, however, still be recovered formally as a functional integral over the coursed grained free energy of the system as in models A and B.},

Quantum isotope effects on the liquid structure are computed in order to examine the dependence of these structural changes on the model used, and a comparison is made to corresponding measurements. The SPC model is found to be in excellent agreement with experimental results; for this model the oxygen--oxygen pair distribution function shows a change in shape and slight shift to smaller distance of the second-neighbor peak when going from D2O to H2O. In contrast, the other two models both show a distinct outward shift of this peak. This difference between models can be attributed to subtle differences in the direct interaction energies of second-nearest-neighbor molecules.},

This linearized Dean equation with a tracer taken apart is validated by the reproduction of previous results on the mean-field liquid structure and transport properties. Then, the tracer is submitted to an external force and we compute the density profile around it, its mobility and its diffusion coefficient. Our results exhibit effects such as bias enhanced diffusion that are very similar to those observed in the opposite limit of a hard core lattice gas, indicating the robustness of these effects. Our predictions are successfully tested against Brownian dynamics simulations.},

We use a mean-field equation for the colloidal density to get an analytical expression of the drag force felt by a probe pulled at constant velocity through the suspension. Our results show that inertia can indeed induce shear thickening by allowing density waves to propagate through the suspension.},

Based on a modified fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)-setup, this method is improved by introducing an external ruler for measuring the diffusion time by generating two laterally shifted and overlapping laser foci at a fixed and known distance. Data fitting is facilitated by a new two-parameter model to describe the molecule detection function (MDF). We present a recorded MDF and show the excellent agreement with the fitting model. We measure the diffusion coefficient of the red fluorescent dye Atto655 under various conditions and compare these values with a value achieved by gradient pulsed field NMR (GPF NMR). From these measurements we conclude, that the new measurement scheme is robust against optical and photophysical artefacts which are inherent to standard FCS.

  abstract = {Molecular mechanics models have been applied extensively to study the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids. Here we report the development of a third-generation point-charge all-atom force field for proteins. Following the earlier approach of Cornell et al., the charge set was obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of dipeptides calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. The main-chain torsion parameters were obtained by fitting to the energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme di-peptides calculated using MP2/ccpVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. All other parameters were taken from the existing AMBER data base. The major departure from previous force fields is that all quantum mechanical calculations were done in the condensed phase with continuum solvent models and an effective dielectric constant of 4. We anticipate that this force field parameter set will address certain critical short comings of previous force fields in condensed-phase simulations of proteins. Initial tests on peptides demonstrated a high-degree of similarity between the calculated and the statistically measured Ramanchandran maps for both Ace-Gly-Nme and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides. Some highlights of our results include (1) well-preserved balance between the extended and helical region distributions, and (2) favorable type-II poly-proline helical region in agreement with recent experiments. Backward compatibility between the new and Cornell et al. charge sets, as judged by overall agreement between dipole moments, allows a smooth transition to the new force field in the area of ligand-binding calculations. Test simulations on a large set of proteins are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Carboxylated polymers of intrinsic microporosity (carboxylated PIMs) are reported as potential high-performance materials for membrane-based gas separation. Carboxylated PIM membranes were prepared by in situ hydrolysis of the nitrile groups of PIM-1 films. Structural characterization was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). The degree of hydrolysis was determined by carbon elemental analysis. The thermal properties were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Compared with PIM-1, carboxylated PIMs with different degrees of hydrolysis have similar thermal and mechanical properties but show higher selectivity for gas pairs such as O2/N2, CO2/N2, He/N2, and H2/N2 with a corresponding decrease in permeability. Selectivity coupled to high permeability combines to exceed the Robeson upper-bound line for the O2/N2 gas pair. This work demonstrates that significant improvements in gas separation properties may be obtained through postmodification of nitrile-based PIM membranes. The present work improves the understanding of the relationship of structure/permeation properties and also extends the PIM spectrum beyond those reported previously. In addition, the incorporation of carboxylic acid sites has the potential for further modification reactions such as grafting and cross-linking.},

  abstract = {The experimental analysis of the equilibrium between H2O, D2O and HOD in the liquid phase by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is tricky because of the difficulty in observing the HOD spectrum. This problem is primarily due to chemical exchange effects. Thus very few NMR methods have been suggested to study this equilibrium. A technique for studying it and determining the equilibrium constant K, is described. A direct measurement of K is carried out, without using additives, which could change the nature of the equilibrium. The described method is designed to measure the scalar coupling constant. A simple proton NMR experiment is recorded and the experimental data is used by a reconstitution program to generate a set of new signals, which are analyzed in the time-domain to obtain a resulting spectrum, where the HOD can be observed as well as the line of H2O. The relative areas corresponding to these multiplets are measured and the equilibrium constant K is determined. It was found to be K=3.86{\textpm}0.01 at 298 {$^\circ$}K, a value which perfectly agrees with those determined by theoretical calculations and other experimental techniques.},

  abstract = {We describe a method for determining chemical kinetic constants and diffusion coefficients by measuring the rates of decay of spontaneous concentration fluctuations. The equilibrium of the system is not disturbed during the measurement. We measure the number of molecules of a specified type in a defined open volume as a function of time and compute the time course of the deviations from the thermodynamic mean concentration. The method is based on the principle that the rates of decay of spontaneous microscopic fluctuations are determined by the same phenomenological rate coefficients as those of macroscopic departures from equilibrium which result from external perturbations. Hence, an analysis of fluctuations yields the same chemical rate constants and diffusion coefficients as are measured by conventional procedures. In practice the number of the specified molecules is measured by a property such as absorbance or fluorescence which is specific and sensitive to chemical change. The sample volume is defined by a light beam which traverses the cell. As the molecules appear in or disappear from the light beam, either due to diffusion or chemical reaction, their concentration fluctuations give rise to corresponding fluctuations of the intensity of absorbed or emitted light. This paper presents the theory needed to derive chemical rate constants and diffusion coefficients from these fluctuations in light intensity. The theory is applied to three examples of general interest: pure diffusion in the absence of chemical reaction; the binding of a small rapidly diffusing ligand to a larger slowly diffusing macromolecule; and a unimolecular isomerization. The method should be especially useful in studying highly cooperative systems, relatively noncooperative systems with intermediate states closely spaced in free energy, small systems, and systems not readily subject to perturbations of state.},

A silica force field is introduced that resolves numerous shortcomings of prior silica force fields over the last 30 years and reduces uncertainties in computed interfacial properties relative to experiment from several 100\% to less than 5\%. In addition, a silica surface model database is introduced for the full range of variable surface chemistry and pH (Q2, Q3, Q4 environments with adjustable degree of ionization) that have shown to determine selective molecular recognition. The force field enables accurate computational predictions of aqueous interfacial properties of all types of silica, which is substantiated by extensive comparisons to experimental measurements. The parameters are integrated into multiple force fields for broad applicability to biomolecules, polymers, and inorganic materials (AMBER, CHARMM, COMPASS, CVFF, PCFF, INTERFACE force fields). We also explain mechanistic details of molecular adsorption of water vapor, as well as significant variations in the amount and dissociation depth of superficial cations at silica-water interfaces that correlate with {$\zeta$}potential measurements and create a wide range of aqueous environments for adsorption and self-assembly of complex molecules. The systematic analysis of binding conformations and adsorption free energies of distinct peptides to silica surfaces will be reported separately in a companion paper. The models aid to understand and design silica nanomaterials in 3D atomic resolution and are extendable to chemical reactions.},

We highlighted preferential interactions between ethanol and graphene, indicating high selectivity and suggesting that the graphene pore is effective for separating water from ethanol. Ethanol molecules act as precursors to trigger water adsorption due to favorable hydrogen bond interactions. We shed light on a nonmonotonic behavior of surface tension that closely follows the adsorption isotherm. We demonstrate that the decrease in surface tension is a consequence of the negative ethanol-ethanol surface tension contribution, in line with a specific interfacial organization leading to an ``intramolecular'' phase separation. Additionally, we show the existence of local phase separation between water and ethanol close to the solid surface, where ethanol molecules are preferentially adsorbed, forming a first interfacial layer with less water and a second layer rich in water. This generates a multilayer organization and an interfacial microphase separation. By using a gravitational field mimicking the confinement effect, we numerically and experimentally highlight that the water-ethanol interface between two bulk phases is gravitationally stabilized.},

Use of B-splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N\,log(N). For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 {\AA} or less.},

We show that the friction coefficient exhibits a strong curvature dependence; while friction is independent of confinement for the graphene slab, it decreases with carbon nanotube radius for water inside, but increases for water outside. As a paradigm the friction coefficient is found to vanish below a threshold diameter for armchair nanotubes. Using a statistical description of the interfacial friction, we highlight here a structural origin of this curvature dependence, mainly associated with a curvature-induced incommensurability between the water and carbon structures. These results support the recent experiments reporting fast transport of water in nanometric carbon nanotube membranes.},

Given a simulation problem and a step size, the method automatically chooses the optimal scheme out of an available family of numerical integrators. Although we focus on two-stage splitting integrators, the idea may be used with more general families. In each instance, the system-specific integrating scheme identified by our approach is optimal in the sense that it provides the best conservation of energy for harmonic forces. The AIA method has been implemented in the BCAM-modified GROMACS software package. Numerical tests in molecular dynamics and hybrid Monte Carlo simulations of constrained and unconstrained physical systems show that the method successfully realizes the fail-safe strategy. In all experiments, and for each of the criteria employed, the AIA is at least as good as, and often significantly outperforms the standard Verlet scheme, as well as fixed parameter, optimized two-stage integrators. In particular, for the systems where harmonic forces play an important role, the sampling efficiency found in simulations using the AIA is up to 5 times better than the one achieved with other tested schemes.},

The interplay between the relative binding energy is briefly discussed in conjunction with the incomplete mixing of alcohol--water systems.},

  abstract = {A statistical mechanical treatment of high polymer solutions has been carried out on the basis of an idealized model, originally proposed by Meyer, which is analogous to the one ordinarily assumed in the derivation of the ``ideal'' solution laws for molecules of equal size. There is obtained for the entropy of mixing of n solvent and N linear polymer molecules (originally disoriented), {$\Delta$}S=-k[(n/{$\beta$}) ln v1+N ln v2] where v1 and v2 are volume fractions and {$\beta$} is the number of solvent molecules replaceable by a freely orienting segment of the polymer chain. This expression is similar in form to the classical expression for equal-sized molecules, mole fractions having been replaced by volume fractions. When the disparity between the sizes of the two components is great, this expression gives entropies differing widely from the classical values, which accounts for the large deviations of high polymer solutions from ``ideal'' behavior. The entropy of disorientation of a perfectly arranged linear polymer is found to be of the order of R cal. per chain segment. After introducing a suitable heat of mixing term, partial molal free energies are computed, and the calculations are compared with experimental data for all concentrations. Phase equilibria have been calculated in the region of partial miscibility. The theory predicts, in agreement with experiment, that the critical composition for partial miscibility lies at a low concentration of polymer. Low intrinsic viscosities of polymers dissolved in poor solvents are attributed to the tendency for the molecule to assume a more compact configuration in such an environment.},

Several nanoconfined systems such as water and ionic liquids, together with an equally impressive array of nanoconfining media such as carbon nanotube, graphene and graphene oxide have received increasingly growing interest in the past years. Water is the first system that has been reviewed in this article, due to its important role in transport phenomena in environmental sciences. Water is often considered as a highly nanoconfined system, due to its reduction to a few layers of water molecules between the extended surface of large macromolecules. The second system discussed here is ionic liquids, which have been widely studied in the modern green chemistry movement. Considering the great importance of ionic liquids in industry, and also their oil/water counterpart, nanoconfined ionic liquid system has become an important area of research with many fascinating applications. Furthermore, the method of molecular dynamics simulation is one of the major tools in the theoretical study of water and ionic liquids in nanoconfinement, which increasingly has been joined with experimental procedures. In this way, the choice of water and ionic liquids in nanoconfinement is justified by applying molecular dynamics simulation approaches in this review article.},

As one of the early members of the family of polymers of intrinsic microporosity, it had never been tested as a gas separation membrane because of insufficient mechanical resistance. This has been solved only recently, allowing the preparation of robust self-standing films. Molecular modelling studies demonstrated a high fractional free volume (34\%) and an elevated surface area (642\,m2\,g-1), and the latter is in good agreement with experimental BET results. Pure gas permeabilities measured on a fixed-volume time-lag instrument at 1\,bar compare well with the results of mixed separation tests on a variable volume setup from 1-6\,bar(a). Molecular modelling and independent sorption measurements on a gravimetric sorption balance both show strong dual-mode sorption behaviour, especially for CO2 and to a lesser extent for CH4. Temperature-dependent pure gas permeation measurements show typical Arrhenius behaviour, with a clear increase in the activation energy for diffusion with the increasing molecular size of the gas, indicating high size-selectivity. This is in agreement with the highly rigid PIM structure, determined by AFM force spectroscopy measurements. The dual-mode behaviour results in a moderate pressure dependence of the CO2 permeability and the CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity, all slightly decreasing with increasing pressure. The presence of humidity in the gas stream has a remarkable small effect on the membrane performance, which is probably due to the high fluorine content and the consequently low water vapour solubility in the polymer, as confirmed by gravimetric sorption measurements. The manuscript describes an extensive study on the structure-property relationships in PIM-2.},

Although the MD simulations for GO and the reduced GO models revealed that the flexibility of the interlayer spacing could be attributed to the oxygen-functional groups of GO, the ultra-large GO model cannot well explain the observed swelling of GO from XRD experiments. Our MD simulations propose a realistic GO interlayer structure constructed by staggered stacking of flexible GO sheets, which can explain very well the swelling nature upon water adsorption. The transmission electron microscopic (TEM) observation also supports the non-regular staggered stacking structure of GO. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of the two distinct types of adsorbed water molecules in the staggered stacking: water bonded with hydrophilic functional groups and ``free'' mobile water. Finally, we show that the staggered stacking of GO plays a crucial role in H/D isotopic recognition in water adsorption, as well as the high mobility of water molecules.},

Due to its uniqueness, water presents numerous anomalies with respect to most simple liquids, showing polyamorphism both in the liquid and in the glassy state. We first describe the thermodynamic scenarios hypothesized for the supercooled region and in particular among them the liquid--liquid critical point scenario that has so far received more experimental evidence. We then review the most recent structural indicators, the two-state model picture of water, and the importance of cooperative effects related to the fact that water is a hydrogen-bonded network liquid. We show throughout the review that water's peculiar properties come into play also when water is in solution, confined, and close to biological molecules. Concerning dynamics, upon mild supercooling water behaves as a fragile glass former following the mode coupling theory, and it turns into a strong glass former upon further cooling. Connections between the slow dynamics and the thermodynamics are discussed. The translational relaxation times of density fluctuations show in fact the fragile-to-strong crossover connected to the thermodynamics arising from the existence of two liquids. When considering also rotations, additional crossovers come to play. Mobility--viscosity decoupling is also discussed in supercooled water and aqueous solutions. Finally, the polyamorphism of glassy water is considered through experimental and simulation results both in bulk and in salty aqueous solutions. Grains and grain boundaries are also discussed.},

Alcohol/water is one of the most common systems in liquid-liquid separation. As one of the most focused systems, recent studies have found that ethanol molecules were preferentially adsorbed on the inner surface of the pore wall and formed an adsorbed ethanol layer under 2D nanoconfinement. To evaluate the effect of the alcohol adsorption layer on the mobility of water molecules, molecular simulations were performed to investigate four types of alcohol/water binary mixtures confined under a 20 {\AA} graphene slit. Residence times of the water molecules covering the alcohol layer were in the order of methanol/water {$<$} ethanol/water {$<$} 1-propanol/water {$<$} 1-butanol/water. Detailed microstructural analysis of the hydrogen bonding (H-bond) network elucidated the underlying mechanism on the molecular scale in which a small average number of H-bonds between the preferentially adsorbed alcohol molecules and the surrounding water molecules could induce a small degree of damage to the H-bond network of the water molecules covering the alcohol layer, resulting in the long residence time of the water molecules.},

  abstract = {A computer program, NanoFiltran, was developed to simulate the mass transport of multi-ionic aqueous solutions in charged nanofiltration (NF) membranes, based on the Donnan steric partitioning pore and dielectric exclusion (DSPM\&DE) model, with incorporation of the non-ideality of electrolyte solutions and concentration polarization effects in the membrane/feed-solution interface. With this computer program, the extended Nernst--Planck (ENP) equations are discretized inside the membrane, using the finite-difference scheme. The discretized ENP equations together with the other model equations are linearized in order to obtain a system of equations that are solved simultaneously. The linearized system of equations is based on an initial guess for the electrical potential and ions concentrations profiles, which are updated iteratively. A robust method of under-relaxation of the electrical potential and ions concentrations ensures that the convergence is achieved even for NF systems that exhibit a very stiff numerical behaviour. The prediction of observed solute rejection coefficients compare very well with a set of experimental and numerical values reported in the literature, for a multi-ionic NF system [W.R. Bowen, A.W. Mohammad, Diafiltration by nanofiltration: prediction and optimization, AIChE J. 44(8) (1998) 1799]. The numerical stability of the computer program is analyzed for a very stiff NF system of three ions and the predictions of the concentration and potential profiles within the membrane yielded by the NanoFiltran and by the fourth order Runge--Kutta method are compared and discussed. The results show that NanoFiltran is a valuable tool for accurate and robust prediction of the mass transfer in nanofiltration of multi-ionic solutions. The computer program NanoFiltran is available under a free software license.},

In each mixture, for ethanol the OPLS force field was used, combined with three different water force fields, the SPC/E, the TIP4P-2005, and the SWM4-DP. Water potential models were distinguished on the basis of deviations between calculated and measured total scattering X-ray structure factors aided by ethanol-water pair binding energy comparison. No single water force field could provide the best agreement with experimental data at all concentrations: at the ethanol content of 80\% the SWM-DP, for 60 mol \% the SWM4-DP and the TIP4P-2005, whereas for the 40 and 20 mol \% mixtures TIP4P-2005 water force field provided the closest match. Coordination numbers and hydrogen bonds/molecule values were calculated, revealing that the oxygen-oxygen first coordination numbers strongly overestimate the average number of hydrogen bonds/molecule. The center-of-molecule distributions indicate that the ethanol-ethanol first coordination sphere expands with increasing water concentration while the size of the first water-water coordination sphere does not change. Various two and three-dimensional distributions were calculated that reveal the differences between simulations with different water force fields.

To this day, many properties of water and its mixtures, in particular, under confinement, are not understood. In recent years, molecular dynamics simulations developed into a powerful tool to improve our knowledge in this field. Here, our simulation results for water and aqueous mixtures in the bulk and in various confinements are reviewed and some new simulation data are added to improve our knowledge about the role of interfaces.

In the course of MD simulation, initially, the branched polyimide membranes are built to obtain the PIMs' model. Then the low-density membrane models undergo a consecutive simulation procedure of compression and relaxation to achieve the experimental density of equilibrated membrane. The structure of the constructed membranes is analyzed by calculating: dihedral angles, radius of gyration, fractional free volume, accessible free volume, cavity size distribution, and surface area. The behavior of the membranes against penetration and permeation of the studied gases is determined by evaluating the diffusion and solubility coefficients of the gases and by employing MD and MC simulation techniques, respectively. Comparison of the structural properties of the membranes shows that the PIM membranes with larger side branch groups in their polymeric chain structure are more rigid and therefore, due to restriction in chain packing and cavity formation between polymer chains, the free volume in the membrane's structure increases which as a result would promote the diffusion and permeation of gases into the membrane, where, the obtained results indicate that the membrane with C4H9, as the largest side branch in its polymer chain, has the greatest diffusivity and permeation. Also, the highest selectivity for all studied binary gas mixtures is manifested by the PIM membrane with C4H9 at its side branch, however, for (CO2/CH4) and (H2S/CH4) binary mixtures CF3 as the side branch of PIM membrane represents an acceptable selectivity. The obtained results illustrate that in addition to the membrane free volume, other parameters are influential in gas separation by these polymeric membranes which require further consideration. These parameters include gas adsorption, specific surface area of the membrane for adsorption, the size of gas molecules and their interaction with the PIM membranes which need to be investigated and discussed in the light of the obtained results. To the best of knowledge, based on a thorough investigation of the literature, no similar work can be cited which includes detailed properties of PIM membranes at the atomic scale by using quantum mechanical and simulation techniques in order to elucidate the behavior of PIMs for gas separation.},

  author = {Ghosh, Rikhia and Bagchi, Biman},
  abstract = {Since the structural transformations observed in water-ethanol binary mixtures are apparently driven by relatively weak intermolecular forces (like hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding) that often cooperate to form self-assembled structures, one expects the aggregation properties to show strong temperature dependence. We study the effect of temperature on the formation of transient ethanol clusters as well as on the dynamic density heterogeneity induced in the system due to such clustering. The dynamic heterogeneity is expected to occur on small length scales with short lifetime -- both are expected to be temperature dependent. Indeed, a major finding of the work is strong temperature dependence of the extent of structural heterogeneity. Distinct signature of static and dynamic heterogeneity of ethanol molecules is also found to appear with lowering of temperature. This is attributed to the formation of transient ethanol clusters that are known to exhibit considerably small lifetime (order of a few picosecond). The transient dynamical features of dynamic heterogeneity are expected to affect those relaxation processes occurring at subpicosecond time scales. On the other hand, strong temperature dependence of micro-structure formation can be anticipated to be due to enhanced structural order stimulated in the system with lowering of temperature. Present analyses reveal a number of interesting features which were not explored beforehand in this widely studied binary mixture.},

We compare the Frenkel line (FL) crossover features of partially confined LJ fluids to that of the bulk LJ fluids in supercritical phase. Five different spacings have been chosen in this study and the FL crossover characteristics have been monitored for each of these spacings for temperatures ranging from 240\,K to 1500\,K keeping the pressure fixed at 5000\,bar. We characterize the FL crossover using density of states (DoS) function and find that partially confined supercritical fluids~(SCF) exhibit a progressive shift of FL crossover point to higher temperatures for smaller spacings. While the DoS perpendicular to the walls shows persistent oscillatory modes, the parallel component exhibits a smooth crossover from an oscillatory to non-oscillatory characteristics representative of FL crossover. We find that the vanishing of peaks in DoS parallel to the walls indicates that the SCF no longer supports shear mode excitations and could serve as an identifier of the FL crossover for confined systems just as is done for the bulk. Layer heights of density profiles, self-diffusivity and the peak heights of radial distribution function parallel to the walls also feature the FL crossover consistent with the DoS criteria. Surprisingly, self-diffusivity undergoes an Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius crossover at low temperatures for smaller spacings as a result of enhanced structural order evidenced via pair-excess entropy. This feature, typical of glass-forming liquids and binary supercooled liquids, is found to develop from the glass-like characteristic slowdown and strong caging in confined supercritical fluid, evidenced via mean squared displacement and velocity autocorrelation function respectively, over intermediate timescales.},

  abstract = {Prepeak in the structure factor of alcohols is known for a half century and was attributed to one of two mechanisms (i) self-assembly in aggregates and (ii) existence of spatial heterogeneity. Although both explnations are often argued the molecular origin is yet unclear. In this work, molecular dynamics simulation of neat alcohols and their mixtures in the presence of an apolar liquid in bulk and in confined phases is performed to unveil and to clarify the origin of the prepeak at the molecular scale. Unambiguously, we show that the existence of the prepeak is the result of the self-assembly in clusters leading to long-range correlations rather than the spatial heterogeneity. We also establish that the confinement of neat liquids at the nanoscale does not erase the clustering and the prepeak but strongly reduce the spatial heterogeneity. Regarding the binary alcohol/toluene mixtures, we highlight the possibility to erase the clustering and the spatial heterogeneity from nanoconfinement inducing the formation of a core--shell structure. By tuning the interfacial chemistry and pore size, we shed light on the possibility to control the spatial heterogeneity, the self-assembly, and the microphase separation.},

Here, we study this phenomenon as a function of membrane thickness, electrolyte flow rate, and solvent washing using a diagnostic flow cell configuration. We find that the rate and magnitude of resistance rise can be significantly reduced through the combination of low electrolyte flow rate and solvent prewash. Further, our results indicate that, since the increase is not associated with irreversible chemical and structural changes, the membrane performance can be recovered via ex-situ or in-situ solvent washes.},

Accurately modeling the nanoscale dynamics of non-equilibrium reactive systems and how they respond to external stimuli is challenging, especially if both atomistic resolution and large scales ({$>$}105 atoms) are required. REACTER is a protocol for modeling chemical reactions during classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Coupling traditional fixed-valence force fields with heuristic reactive MD is advantageous for largescale simulations of dynamic systems that can include the complex reaction mechanisms common in organic chemistry. This paper details the current features of the LAMMPS implementation of REACTER, known as fix bond/react, and surveys recent applications of the protocol in a variety of fields, including photopolymers, highperformance composites, and membranes. Conceived as a tool for modeling polymerization processes, the scope of REACTER is expanding as it is applied to new materials and supporting features are implemented. Three new case studies are presented that highlight the capabilities of REACTER, including modeling hierarchical materials, the mechanics of molecular machines, and large-scale dynamics of heterogeneous catalysis.},

The method is applicable to a broad range of chemical reactions and permits much larger and longer reactive simulations than existing approaches. One or more competing multistep reactions or series of reactions can be invoked simultaneously. Special treatment can be applied to neighboring atoms to relax high-energy configurations while the simulation progresses. The original implementation of REACTER, which was included in the open-source LAMMPS simulation package as fix bond/react, was only available for serial simulations. This work describes the expansion of the REACTER protocol for use in parallel simulations, as well as the addition of various new options, including deletion of reaction byproducts, reversible reactions, and custom reaction constraints. The capability of the parallel implementation is demonstrated through large-scale simulations (200000+ atoms) of the polymerization of polystyrene and nylon-6,6. The morphologies of both polymers are analyzed after reaching {$>$}99\% extent of polymerization. Finally, the newly added reversible reactions feature is demonstrated by rupturing these highly entangled systems under uniaxial strain by defining a chain scission reaction.},

From detailed studies of the dynamics of hydration of water in biological materials, the importance of hydrogen and molecular exchange to the longitudinal relaxation time of T1 was demonstrated. In this work, exchange times of both H2O and D2O in hydrophilic silica gel are varied in a controlled fashion in a wide range using disodium hydrogen phosphate, and the effect of physical exchange on spin relaxation is quantified for the first time in such systems using the exchange-mediated reorientation model.},

  abstract = {A series of linker-substituted ultramicroporous CALF-20 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were built in silico, and their CO2 capture performances over N2 in flue gas conditions were systematically computationally explored. Among the various linker substitutions explored, squarate-linker-incorporated CALF-20 (SquCALF-20) was demonstrated to show a larger CO2 uptake at 0.15 bar (3.6 mmol/g) and higher CO2/N2 selectivity (500) in dry conditions compared to pristine CALF-20. Interestingly, this MOF was shown to maintain a high level of CO2 capture performance even in the presence of humidity, although it starts to adsorb H2O at lower relative humidity compared to CALF-20. Because squaric acid is a semiconductor industry feedstock and the few-already published squaratebased MOFs are chemically robust, this engineered SquCALF-20 offers a promising avenue for cost-effective CO2 capture via physisorption, with potential applications in addressing environmental concerns associated with CO2 emissions.},

Here, we perform simulations of particles reversibly adsorbing at the surface of a nanopore and show that the fluctuations in the number of adsorbed particles exhibit low-frequency pink noise. We furthermore propose theoretical modeling for the timedependent adsorption of particles on the nanopore surface for various geometries, which predicts a frequency spectrum in very good agreement with the simulation results. Altogether, our results highlight that the low-frequency noise takes its origin in the reversible adsorption of ions at the pore surface combined with the long-lasting excursions of the ions in the reservoirs. The scaling regime of the power spectrum extends down to a cutoff frequency which is far smaller than simple diffusion estimates. Using realistic values for the pore dimensions and the adsorption-desorption kinetics, this predicts the observation of pink noise for frequencies down to the hertz for a typical solid-state nanopore, in good agreement with experiments.},

  abstract = {NMR relaxometry is a powerful and wellestablished experimental approach for characterizing dynamic processes in soft matter systems. All-atom (AA) resolved simulations are typically employed to gain further microscopic insights while reproducing the relaxation rates R1. However, such approaches are limited to time and length scales that prevent to model systems such as long polymer chains or hydrogels. Coarse graining (CG) can overcome this barrier at the cost of losing atomistic details that impede the calculation of NMR relaxation rates. Here, we address this issue by performing a systematic characterization of dipolar relaxation rates R1 on a PEG-H2O mixture at two different levels of details: AA and CG. Remarkably, we show that NMR relaxation rates R1 obtained at the CG level obey the same trends when compared to AA calculations but with a systematic offset. This offset is due to, on the one hand, the lack of an intramonomer component and, on the other hand, the inexact positioning of the spin carriers. We show that the offset can be corrected for quantitatively by reconstructing a posteriori the atomistic details for the CG trajectories.},

  abstract = {Tillandsia landbeckii is a rootless plant thriving in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert of Chile. These plants use unique cellulose-based microscopic structures called trichomes to collect fresh water from coastal fog. The trichomes rely on a passive mechanism to maintain an asymmetrical transport of water: they allow for the fast absorption of liquid water deposited by sporadic fog events while preventing evaporation during extended drought periods. Inspired by the trichome's design, we study fluid transport through a micrometric valve. Combining Grand Canonical Monte Carlo with Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations, we first analyze the adsorption and transport of a fluid through a single nanopore at different chemical potentials. We then scale up the atomic results using a lattice approach, and simulate the transport at the micrometric scale. Results obtained for a model Lennard-Jones fluid and TIP4P/2005 water were compared, allowing us to identify the key physical parameters for achieving a passive hydraulic valve. Our results show that the difference in transport properties of water vapor and liquid water within the cellulose layer is the basis for the ability of the Tillandsia trichome to function as a water valve. Finally, we predict a critical pore dimension above which the cellulose layer can form an efficient valve.},

Here, we use nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion measurements to better understand the dynamic properties of water within two types of salt crusts: sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). Our experimental results display a stronger dispersion of the relaxation time T1 with frequency for the case of sodium sulfate as compared to sodium chloride salt crusts. To gain insight into these results, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of salt solutions confined within slit nanopores made of either NaCl or Na2SO4. We find a strong dependence of the value of the relaxation time T1 on pore size and salt concentration. Our simulations reveal the complex interplay between the adsorption of ions at the solid surface, the structure of water near the interface, and the dispersion of T1 at low frequency, which we attribute to adsorption--desorption events.},

Although molecular details are crucial to the pore performance, permeability is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation at the entrances. Could the hourglass shape of aquaporins optimize such entrance effects? We show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the channel permeability. Strikingly, the optimal opening angles compare well with the angles measured in a large variety of aquaporins, suggesting that their hourglass shape could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal permeability. This work also provides guidelines to optimize the performances of artificial nanopores, with applications in desalination, ultrafiltration, or energy conversion.           ,              The ubiquitous aquaporin channels are able to conduct water across cell membranes, combining the seemingly antagonist functions of a very high selectivity with a remarkable permeability. Whereas molecular details are obvious keys to perform these tasks, the overall efficiency of transport in such nanopores is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation arising at the connection between the nanoconstriction and the nearby bulk reservoirs. In this contribution, we focus on these so-called entrance effects and specifically examine whether the characteristic hourglass shape of aquaporins may arise from a geometrical optimum for such hydrodynamic dissipation. Using a combination of finite-element calculations and analytical modeling, we show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the overall channel permeability. Moreover, the optimal opening angles that maximize the permeability are found to compare well with the angles measured in a large variety of aquaporins. This suggests that the hourglass shape of aquaporins could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal hydrodynamic transport. Finally, in a biomimetic perspective, these results provide guidelines to design artificial nanopores with optimal performances.},

  abstract = {Under ambient atmospheric conditions, a thin film of water wets many solid surfaces, including insulators, ice, and salt. The film thickness as well as its transport behavior sensitively depend on the surrounding humidity. Understanding this intricate interplay is of the highest relevance for water transport through porous media, particularly in the context of soil salinization induced by evaporation. Here, we use molecular simulations to evaluate the transport properties of thin water films on prototypical salt and soil interfaces, namely NaCl and silica solid surfaces. Our results show two distinct regimes for water transport: at low water coverage, the film permeance scales linearly with the adsorbed amount, in agreement with the activated random walk model. For thicker water films, the permeance scales as the adsorbed amount to the power of 3, in line with the Stokes equation. By comparing results obtained for silica and NaCl surfaces, we find that, at low water coverage, water permeance at the silica surface is considerably lower than at the NaCl surface, which we attribute to difference in hydrogen bonding. We also investigate the effect of atomic surface defects on the transport properties. Finally, in the context of water transport through the porous material, we determine the humidity-dependent crossover between a vapor-dominated and a thin film-dominated transport regimes depending on the pore size.},

Results are extracted for different P{\'e}clet numbers and compared to the predictions by a theory developed for a rigid axisymmetric particle with orientation confined to the flow-gradient plane. The theory is based on the resolution of a one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation for the angle {$\varphi$} made by one of the particle's diameters with the flow direction. Remarkably, our results show that the essential features of the three-dimensional orientational statistics of the nanographene are captured by the one-dimensional model, given that the hydrodynamic velocity is closed in terms of the slip length {$\lambda$}. Finally, we explore the situation in which multiple nanographenes are suspended in the liquid, and show that slip results in a reduction in specific viscosity.},

  abstract = {A new method called               Pepsi-SAXS               is presented that calculates small-angle X-ray scattering profiles from atomistic models. The method is based on the multipole expansion scheme and is significantly faster compared with other tested methods. In particular, using the Nyquist--Shannon--Kotelnikov sampling theorem, the multipole expansion order is adapted to the size of the model and the resolution of the experimental data. It is argued that by using the adaptive expansion order, this method has the same quadratic dependence on the number of atoms in the model as the Debye-based approach, but with a much smaller prefactor in the computational complexity. The method has been systematically validated on a large set of over 50 models collected from the BioIsis and SASBDB databases. Using a laptop, it was demonstrated that               Pepsi-SAXS               is about seven, 29 and 36 times faster compared with               CRYSOL               ,               FoXS               and the three-dimensional Zernike method in               SAStbx               , respectively, when tested on data from the BioIsis database, and is about five, 21 and 25 times faster compared with               CRYSOL               ,               FoXS               and               SAStbx               , respectively, when tested on data from SASBDB.

The interaction is quite weak with CH4 as donor but is enhanced by 1 kcal/mol with each F added to the donor. The CH{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}O interaction behaves very much like a conventional OH{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}O H-bond in most respects, including shifts in electron density that accompany the formation of the bond and the magnitudes of the various components of the interaction energy. The two sorts of H-bonds also gravitate toward a similar equilibrium geometry and are comparably sensitive to deformations from that structure. In a quantitative sense, while both CH{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}O and OH{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}O prefer a linear configuration, the former is somewhat more easily bent and is less sensitive to stretches from its equilibrium H-bond length. Whereas the OH bond has been shown to stretch and undergo a red shift in its vibrational frequency upon formation of a H-bond, the CH bond of the molecules studied here follows the opposite trend, a contraction and a blue shift. Analysis demonstrates that this opposite pattern is not due to any fundamental distinction between the two interactions, since the same sets of forces are acting on both. It is concluded that the CH{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}{\quotesinglbase}O interaction can, indeed, be categorized as a true H-bond.},

  abstract = {Magnetic hyperthermia is a promising tool as an adjuvant therapy for multimodal cancer treatment. However, the heating efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles in biological conditions is not yet fully understood, especially regarding their dispersion state. In this work, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and hyperthermia experiments were coupled to highlight the role of the aggregation of iron oxide nanoparticles on their heating properties induced by an alternating magnetic field. Bare, poly(acrylic acid), and poly(acrylic acid-co-maleic acid) coated nanoparticles were studied. More precisely, the interparticular interactions were investigated by varying the ionic strength and the pH. Our results show that the specific loss power (SLP) of nanoparticles in small and loose aggregates is similar to that of well dispersed nanoparticles while the formation of large and dense aggregates observed by DLS can be correlated to a decrease of the SLP of the nanoparticles. However, at intermediate aggregation states, DLS experiments alone do not allow to fully comprehend the heating properties of magnetic nanoparticles. Small angle X-ray scattering experiments (SAXS) were performed to get information about the inner structure of the aggregates: the closer the nanoparticles in the aggregates, the less they heat the surrounding medium. These results shed a new light on the negative influence of the interparticular interactions in aggregates on the particles heating efficiency.},

We then show the decoupling of viscosity and structural relaxation time in supercooled water.           ,                             During the last few decades, many experimental and numerical studies have tried to understand the special dynamics of water at low temperatures by measuring structural relaxation times or shear viscosity, but their conclusions strongly depended on the chosen observable and on the range of temperatures considered. Moreover, recent work [               J. Chem. Phys.               2013,               138               , 12A526] showed that viscosity and relaxation times could decouple at low temperature in a model binary mixture, raising questions on their equivalence to study supercooled water. Here we used molecular dynamics simulations with the promising TIP4P/2005f water force field to investigate the behavior of both the shear viscosity and the relaxation times of water in a large range of temperatures, in order to get a consistent picture of the dynamics of supercooled water. We show that the TIP4P/2005f model reproduces accurately the experimental values of both the viscosity and the diffusion coefficient over a very large range of temperatures. Focusing first on the structural relaxation dynamics, we observe a decoupling between the so-called {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-relaxation times of water at               ca.               350 K, suggesting a supercooled-like dynamics over a very large domain of temperatures. By computing shear viscosity over this domain, we compare the accuracy of several phenomenological laws for low temperature dynamics of water to describe both viscosity and {$\alpha$}-relaxation time. Unlike what is usually admitted, our tests suggest those quantities are not coupled at low temperatures, and thus should not be considered equivalent. In particular, deviations from the Stokes--Einstein relation appear at lower temperatures for the viscosity than for the {$\alpha$}-relaxation time. These results open new perspectives to understand the dynamics of supercooled water and show the performance of the TIP4P/2005f force field to characterize it.},

The resulting density profiles illustrate that demixing of solvents occurs at the pore wall region, which is composed of silanol molecules in our case. Ethanol molecules are more likely to attach to the wall via hydrogen bonds than water molecules. A noticeable O-H bond orientation is observed for the ethanol molecules in this region, which can be explained by the formation of two specific hydrogen bonds between ethanol and silanol. Water, in contrast, resides mostly outside the interfacial region and is in favor of forming small hydrogen bonded strings and clusters with other water molecules. This phenomenon is corroborated by both the orientation of ethanol hydroxyl groups and the radial distribution functions of the solvent oxygen atom to the silanol hydrogen atom. Ethanol selectively attaches to the wall and forms a layer close to the wall. The hydrophobic headgroups of these ethanol molecules lead to an internal hydrophobic interface layer, which in turn yields cluster structures in the adjacent water. The self-diffusion of water in the confined ethanol-water mixture at the center of the pore is faster than that of water in the bulk ethanol-water mixture; ethanol, on the other hand, diffuses slower when it is confined.},

  abstract = {Aqueous binary mixtures have received immense attention in recent years because of their extensive application in several biological and industrial processes. The water-ethanol binary mixture serves as a unique system because it exhibits composition-dependent alteration of dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Our present work demonstrates how different compositions of water-ethanol binary mixtures affect the pair hydrophobicity of different hydrophobes. Pair hydrophobicity is measured by the depth of the first minimum (contact minima) of potential of mean force (PMF) profile between two hydrophobes. The pair hydrophobicity is found to be increased with addition of ethanol to water up to a mole fraction of xEtOH = 0.10 and decreased with further addition of ethanol. This observation is shown to be true for three (methane-methane, isobutane-isobutane, and toluene-toluene) different pairs of hydrophobes. Decomposition of PMF into enthalpic and entropic contribution indicates a switch from entropic to enthalpic stabilization of the contact minimum upon addition of ethanol to water. The gain in mixing enthalpy of the binary solvent system upon association of two hydrophobes is found to be the determining factor for the stabilization of contact minimum. Several static/ dynamics quantities (average composition fluctuations, diffusion coefficients, fluctuations in total dipole moment, propensity of ethyl-ethyl association, etc) of the ethanol-water binary mixture also show irregularities around xEtOH = 0.10-0.15. We have also discovered that the hydrogen bonding pattern of ethanol rather than water reveals a change in trend near the similar composition range. As the anomalous behavior of the physical/dynamical properties along with the pair hydrophobicity in an aqueous binary mixture of amphiphilic solutes is a common phenomenon, our results may provide a general viewpoint on these aspects.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data from water nuclei (1H, 2H, and 17O) can provide much information about the state of water in heterogeneous systems. In the present work, we present a theoretical framework for the interpretation of such data and discuss the implications of the theory. Due to the local anisotropy in heterogeneous systems, it is necessary to consider two components of water motion: a fast anisotropic reorientation superposed on a more extensive slow motion. On the basis of the experimentally verified assumption that these motions occur on different time scales, we develop a ''two-step'' model of relaxation, showing that both motions may give important contributions to the relaxation. We derive a simple expression for the relevant correlation function, valid for isotropic systems. Anisotropic systems are also treated, making use of a new symmetry theorem for time correlation functions. The proof of this theorem is given in an Appendix. The magnitudes of the water 2H and 17O quadrupole coupling constants are estimated to 0.222 and 6.67 MHz, respectively. Results of ab\hphantom{,}initio quantum chemical calculations are presented, demonstrating the insensitivity of the water 17O field gradient to nearby ionic species. The possibilities and limitations of the NMR technique in answering the fundamental questions about water structure and dynamics in heterogeneous systems are discussed. We suggest a novel interpretation of the well-known invariance of the ratio of 1H and 2H splittings. Furthermore, we argue that the available NMR data are consistent with a short-ranged ({$\lessequivlnt$}2 molecular layers) perturbation of the water tumbling rate and anisotropy.},

Consequently, these processes influence ecosystem health and functioning and have shaped the biological and environmental co-evolution of Earth over geologic time. Here we employ reactive molecular dynamics simulations, supported by synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy, to derive accurate surface complexation model constants for ferrihydrite-water systems containing aqueous {\textbackslash}ce\{MoO\_4{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}\}. This is achieved by employing a force-field that is adept at capturing the realistic dynamics of surface restructuring, surface charge equilibration, and the evolution of the interfacial water hydrogen bond network in response to adsorption processes or proton transfer events. We inform surface complexation models by exploring the free energy landscape of {\textbackslash}ce\{MoO\_4{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}\} adsorption at the ferrihydrite-water interface at different concentrations. We find how hydration and adsorption induce changes in surface charge, prompting the surface to restructure into more disordered ferrihydrite phases. We observe how the dynamics of adsorbed complexes are concentration-dependent and how surface restructuration, along with adsorption, influence the interfacial hydrogen bond network. By incorporating reactivity, reactive molecular dynamics opens new avenues to study mineral-water interfaces, enriching and refining surface complexation models beyond their foundational assumptions.},

  abstract = {Wall slip unexpectedly increases quickly in supercooled water, with foreseeable consequences for its nanoconfined dynamics and phase behavior.           ,                             Nanofluidics is an emerging field offering innovative solutions for energy harvesting and desalination. The efficiency of these applications depends strongly on liquid--solid slip, arising from a favorable ratio between viscosity and interfacial friction. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that wall slip increases strongly when water is cooled below its melting point. For water on graphene, the slip length is multiplied by up to a factor of five and reaches 230 nm at the lowest simulated temperature,               T               {$\sim$} 225 K; experiments in nanopores can reach much lower temperatures and could reveal even more drastic changes. The predicted fast increase in water slip can also be detected at supercoolings reached experimentally in bulk water, as well as in droplets flowing on anti-icing surfaces. We explain the anomalous slip behavior in the supercooled regime by a decoupling between viscosity and bulk density relaxation dynamics, and we rationalize the wall-type dependence of the enhancement in terms of interfacial density relaxation dynamics. While providing fundamental insights on the molecular mechanisms of hydrodynamic transport in both interfacial and bulk water in the supercooled regime, this study is relevant to the design of anti-icing surfaces, could help explain the subtle phase and dynamical behaviors of supercooled confined water, and paves the way to explore new behaviors in supercooled nanofluidic systems.},

Although the derivation of the algorithm is presented in terms of matrices, no matrix matrix multiplications are needed and only the nonzero matrix elements have to be stored, making the method useful for very large molecules.

Computational Fluid Dynamics or CFD is the analysis of fluid flow, heat and mass transfer and chemical reactions by means of computer-based numerical simulations. CFD has matured into a powerful tool with a wide range of applications in industry and academia. From a reaction engineering perspective, main advantages are reduction of time and costs for reactor design and optimization, and the ability to study systems where experiments can hardly be performed, e.g., hazardous conditions or beyond normal operation limits. However, the simulation results will always remain a reflection of the uncertainty in the underlying models and physicochemical parameters so that in general a careful experimental validation is required.},

The molecular structure of PIM-1 contains sites of contortion (spiro-centres) within a rigid ladder polymer structure. Nitrogen sorption experiments have shown that the polymer, which traps in the glassy state a large amount of interconnected free volume, behaves in many respects like a microporous material. The models obtained by force field-based molecular mechanics and molecular dynamic methods allow a prediction of permeation properties of small gasses, the calculation of N2-sorption isotherms at 77 K, and a determination of free volume distributions. The Gusev--Suter transition state theory (TST) was used to calculate gas solubility and diffusion coefficients for He, H2, Ar, O2, N2, CH4, and Xe. Good agreement with experimental data (factors 1--4) was found. The calculated nitrogen adsorption isotherm at 77 K shows properties typical for sorption on microporous materials. The obtained microporous volume is in good agreement with the respective experimental value. The size distribution function of free volume elements derived from the models agrees well in its range of pore width of 5--15 A{\r{}} with results obtained from experimental sorption data and analyzed with the Horvath-Kawazoe method. Dihedral angle distributions in the backbone reveal a certain, unexpected flexibility of plane segments between the spiro-centres which act as connecting links.},

The effects of the film thickness and the probe radius on both the deformation height of the liquid interface and the distance of the jump to contact at which the liquid comes in direct contact with the probe are investigated. The dynamics of the surface deformation and the role of interface fluctuations are studied in detail. The systems considered belong to the thin-film regime described in a semianalytical model previously established by Ledesma-Alonso et al. (Langmuir 2013, 29, 7749-7757). MD simulations predict that for shallow films, both the distance at which the jump to contact occurs and the surface maximal deformation height increase steadily with the layer thickness regardless of the probe radius, which is in agreement with the previously proposed theoretical model. The deformation of the surface was shown to be unstable because of the strong effect of thermal fluctuations. For each of the considered systems, the film thickness was such that interface fluctuations induced the jump to contact. The comparison of the deformation obtained in MD with the profiles predicted by the continuous model points out the complementarity between the two approaches. The results of the molecular approach not only are consistent with those of the continuous model but also provide more information on the description of nanoscale phenomena. In particular, MD results point out the importance of fluctuations when it comes to the description of the particular dynamics of nanosystems involving soft interfaces. This shows the need to improve continuous models by complementing them with a molecular approach for a better accuracy.},

The free induction decay amplitude accounts for all of the water protons in the sample over the range of water concentrations studies. Two types of model are considered to interpret the transverse NMR relaxation data. It is shown that a multisite fast exchange model which assumes water concentration independent protein binding sites is inconsistent with the data. A crude model that includes the possibility that water molecule motion at all sites may be influenced by subsequent addition of water does account for the observations. A chemical exchange model and a cross-relaxation model are considered as sources of the nonexponential decay observed in the longitudinal relaxation data throughout the temperature and concentration range studied. It is shown that when cross-relaxation between protein protons and water protons is included, long water molecule residence times at protein sites are not required and that the usual approaches to the analysis of water relaxation at surfaces must be altered. The data demonstrate that the rate of water molecule motion decreases with decreasing water content, even though some distribution of motional correlation times may be appropriate. The water in the immediate vicinity of the protein surface appears to be best characterized as a viscous liquid but not as a solid.},

While the behaviour of ethanol-water is well understood, unexpected inversion of the slowest component between the micro and the mesoscale are evidenced in the ethanol-octanol mixture.

  abstract = {The hydrophobic effect, i.e., the poor solvation of nonpolar parts of molecules, plays a key role in protein folding and more generally for molecular self-assembly and aggregation in aqueous media. The perturbation of the water structure accounts for many aspects of protein hydrophobicity. However, to what extent the dispersion interaction between molecular entities themselves contributes has remained unclear. This is so because in peptide folding interactions and structural changes occur on all length scales and make disentangling various contributions impossible. We address this issue both experimentally and theoretically by looking at the force necessary to peel a mildly hydrophobic single peptide molecule from a flat hydrophobic diamond surface in the presence of water. This setup avoids problems caused by bubble adsorption, cavitation, and slow equilibration that complicate the much-studied geometry with two macroscopic surfaces. Using atomic-force spectroscopy, we determine the mean desorption force of a single spider-silk peptide chain as               F               = 58 {\textpm} 8 pN, which corresponds to a desorption free energy of {$\approx$}5               k               B               T               per amino acid. Our all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation including explicit water correspondingly yields the desorption force               F               = 54 {\textpm} 15 pN. This observation demonstrates that standard nonpolarizable force fields used in classical simulations are capable of resolving the fine details of the hydrophobic attraction of peptides. The analysis of the involved energetics shows that water-structure effects and dispersive interactions give contributions of comparable magnitude that largely cancel out. It follows that the correct modeling of peptide hydrophobicity must take the intimate coupling of solvation and dispersive effects into account.},

  abstract = {Direct air capture is a key carbon dioxide removal technology to mitigate climate change and keep the global average temperature rise below 1.5--2 {\textopenbullet}C. This work addresses for the first time the use of ionic liquids for direct air capture connecting their material design by molecular simulation to process modelling. First, 26 different ionic liquids were designed through quantum chemical calculations and their isotherms were computed to identify those with a positive cyclic working capacity at conditions relevant for direct air capture. Then, the most promising ionic liquids were assessed via process simulations in Aspen Plus. A wide range of operating config\- urations were screened by modifying the key process variables: air velocity (1 -- 3 m/s), solvent mass flow (5 -- 50 t/h) and temperature (293 -- 323 K), and regeneration pressure (0.1 -- 1 bar) and temperature (373 -- 393 K). Exergy, energy and productivity were computed to detect optimal operating conditions; moreover, a simplified economic analysis was carried out to highlight the major cost components. The direct air capture system based on [P66614][Im] exhibited the most exergy (5.44 -- 16.73 MJ/kg) and energy (15.15 -- 35.42 MJ/kg) efficiency for similar productivity (0.5 -- 1.3 kg/(m3{$\cdot$}h)) thanks to its enhanced cyclic capacity (0.6 -- 0.3 mol/kg). The mini\- mum exergy required by [P66614][Im]-based DAC process is slightly better than alkali scrubbing (6.21 MJ/kg) and in line with amine (5.59 MJ/kg) scrubbing. In addition, the assessed DAC process has a theoretical potential to operate in the range of 200 \$/tCO2 under reasonable energy and plant expenses. We conclude this work providing guidelines to address future development of direct air capture technologies based on ionic liquids.},

  abstract = {Nanoporous adsorbents can mechanically swell or shrink once upon the accumulation of guest fluid molecules at their internal surfaces or in their cavities. Existing theories in this field attribute such sorption-induced swelling to a tensile force, while shrinkage is always associated with a contractive force. In this study, however, we propose that the sorption-induced deformation of a porous architecture is not solely dictated by the stress conditions but can also be largely influenced by its mechanical anisotropy. In more detail, the sorption-induced deformation of a polymeric slab is investigated using a hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo algorithm. When subjected to water loading, the slab is found to swell along its normal direction and display an overall positive volumetric strain. Moreover, the surface roughness is enhanced as a response to the surface energy decrease induced by the water covering the slab external surface. Unexpectedly, the in-plane deformation of the slab material seems to be highly constrained, so that it is far below its normal counterpart. This anisotropy is enhanced when the slab thickness decreases. With a thickness of around 1.35 nm, an in-plane shrinkage is observed throughout the entire hygroscopic range. A theoretical analysis based on a poromechanical model suggests that the anisotropic mechanical properties, which are common for a slab material, are the essence of the constrained in-plane swelling or even shrinkage under the isotropic sorption-induced tensile forces. This study, unveiling overlooked mechanisms of sorption-induced shrinkage in mechanically anisotropic materials, provides new insights into this field.},

  abstract = {The nuclear magnetic relaxation and the electron-nucleus Overhauser effect on spin {$\frac{1}{2}$} nuclei in solutions containing free radicals are calculated on the assumption that the nuclei and electrons interact by means of magnetic dipole--dipole interactions and scalar spin--spin interactions. The time dependence of the dipole--dipole interactions is assumed to be due to the translational diffusion of the free radicals and the molecules containing the nuclei. Two models are employed for the scalar interactions. In the first of these, there is a scalar interaction only while a molecule is stuck to a free radical, and the time for which they are stuck is a random variable. In the second model, the hypothesis is made that the scalar interaction is a very short range interaction with magnitude               {$\hbar$}A               (               d/R               ) exp [--               {$\lambda$}               (               R--d               )], where               {$\lambda$}               d               {$\gg$} 1,               A               and               {$\lambda$}               are constants,               R               is the distance between a nucleus and an electron, and               d               is a distance of closest approach, inside of which the interaction is zero. In the second model, the time dependence of the scalar interaction, as in the case of the dipole--dipole interactions, is due to the relative diffusion of the molecules and free radicals in the solution. For the second model, it is found that the frequency dependence of the spectral density of a scalar interaction is very similar to the frequency dependence of the spectral density of a dipole--dipole interaction, no matter how short range the scalar interaction is made by making               {$\lambda$}d               very large. For both models of the scalar interaction it is found that the sign of the steady-state Overhauser effect may change from positive to negative as the magnetic field is increased, but that this is more likely to happen for the first model of the scalar interactions than for the second. The interpretation of experiments in terms of the results derived here is discussed, with particular attention given to experiments performed at two different magnetic fields. It is found that in some cases it may be possible to determine which model of the scalar interactions gives better agreement with experiment, and to determine values for the contributions of the scalar and the dipolar interactions, the distance of closest approach, and the relative diffusion coefficient.},

VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more ``representations,'' in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

We provide a comprehensive description of the data processing that we have used for correcting systematic errors, and we provide an estimate of our remaining random errors. The resulting error estimates of our data are smaller then the discrepancies between data sets collected in past x-ray experiments. We find that the older x-ray curves support a family of gOO(r)'s that exhibit a smaller first peak ({$\sim$}2.2), while the current data is better fit with a family of gOO(r)'s with a first peak height of 2.8, and systematic shifts in all peak positions to smaller r.},

The use of finite difference methods permits the solution no matter how complex the form of the pair correlation function (pcf) utilized. In particular, a Percus--Yevick pcf as well as one corrected from computer dynamics, both for hard spheres, are utilized. Good agreement with the experiments of Harmon and Muller on dipolar relaxation in liquid ethane is obtained from this analysis. Effects of ionic interactions in electrolyte solutions upon dipolar relaxation are also obtained in terms of Debye--H{\"u}ckel theory for the pcf. Analytic solutions are given which are appropriate for the proper boundary-value problem for the relative diffusion of molecules (i.e., a distance of minimum approach) that has usually been neglected in the spin relaxation theories. Other molecular dynamics aspects of spin relaxation by translational diffusion in liquids are briefly discussed.},

However, despite its widespread use, key questions regarding the thickness and composition of molecules at the ethanol/water/air surface remain unclear. Recent thermodynamic analyses, Bagheri and co-authors (2016) and Santos and Reis (2018), indicated that the interfacial thickness is not constant. However, the interfacial thickness from these two analyses follows opposite trends. This study aims to provide a detailed description of the thickness and composition of the interfacial layer by combining neutron reflectivity (NR) experiments with rigorous molecular simulation. The interfacial composition was determined from molecular simulations and, in conjunction with the Gibbs excess concentration, used to calculate the interfacial thickness. It was found that the thickness decreased exponentially and reached a plateau of {\textasciitilde} 8.2 {\AA}. The results confirm the trends obtained thermodynamically from surface tension. The study also provides a new theoretical framework to describe the interfacial layer of water/alcohol mixtures.},

The bi-exponential transverse magnetization decay reveals the existence of two water populations in slow exchange. However, the different behaviors of these populations during saturation and desaturation experiments show evidence of a fast exchange of each population with the surface. Two modes of organization of the microstructure of this material are identified through an original model of exchange as a function of the water-to-plaster ratio (0.4 {$\leq$} w/p {$\leq$} 0.6 and 0.7 {$\leq$} w/p {$\leq$} 1). A clear gap is shown in the exchange rate value above w/p = 0.6 that could be representative of a percolation threshold. Both the method and the theory presented can be applied more widely to other porous media with reactive surface areas.},

  abstract = {Using a hierarchical multiscale approach combining quantum mechanics and molecular simulation, we have investigated the adsorption of pure CO2 and N2 and their mixture at room temperature in C168 schwarzite, as a model for nanoporous carbons. First, the adsorbate-adsorbent interaction potential is determined using ab initio quantum mechanics computations, and then the adsorption is predicted using full atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. The extents of adsorption, adsorption energies, and isosteric heats of pure CO2 and N2 simulated with the ab initio potential are found to be higher than those with the empirical Steele potential that had been developed from gas adsorption on planar graphite. The inclusion of the electric quadrupole moment of adsorbate in simulation has no discernible effect on N2 adsorption but results in a larger extent of CO2 adsorption at high coverages. The selectivity of CO2 over N2 in the C168 schwarzite from a model flue gas is predicted to be significantly larger with the ab initio potential than with the Steele potential. This illustrates the importance of an accurate adsorbate-adsorbent interaction potential in determining gas adsorption and suggests that nanoporous carbons might be useful for the separation of flue gases. As a comparison, the adsorption and selectivity of CO2 and N2 in ZSM-5 zeolites are also simulated with the experimentally validated potential parameters. The selectivity in the C168 schwarzite predicted with the ab initio or Steele potential is found to be larger than the selectivity in all-silica ZSM-5, but less than that in Na-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolites.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the rigidity, microporosity and the ideal gas separation properties of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) is very important but seldom studied in detail. Herein, we designed a novel bromine substituted intrinsic microporosity polyimide (PIM-DB-PI), and compared its gas separation properties with a more rigid and microporous PIM-PI-1 (680 vs 435~m2~g-1) from -30 to 30~{$^\circ$}C for the first time. Both PIM-PIs showed improved ideal gas separation properties with their performance for H2/N2, O2/N2, CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 changed from well below the 2008 trade-off lines to approach or even above their latest trade-off lines upon decreasing temperature. The PIM-PI-1 with higher microporosity and rigidity showed higher gas permeability, diffusion and solubility coefficients as well as larger activation energy of permeation (Ep) and diffusion (Ed) than PIM-DB-PI, whereas PIM-DB-PI exhibited higher gas pair selectivity derived from its larger diffusion selectivity (aD), which was attributed to its higher enthalpic selectivity. Besides, the PIM-DB-PI showed a much larger critical penetrate size ((f/c)1/2) than PIM-PI-1 due to its higher flexibility. The above finding indicates that both rigidity and microporosity are very important in fine-tuning the gas transport through the polymer membrane. The microporosity has dominant effect on the gas diffusion selectivity of the membrane and the rigidity has more effect on the critical diffusion penetrate size ((f/c)1/2) of PIM-PI membranes.},

  abstract = {Significance             Large amounts of methane hydrate---which consists of water forming molecular ice cages around methane molecules---are trapped in the porosity of rocks and seafloors. The impact of this so-called ``burning ice'' on our environment remains unclear (methane is a potent greenhouse gas), especially the parameters driving its phase stability and kinetics. Here, using molecular modeling, we identify the mechanisms involved in the formation/dissociation of confined methane hydrate. The phase stability of confined methane hydrate is shown to be restricted to a narrower temperature/pressure range with faster underlying formation/dissociation kinetics. Such facilitated freezing, which helps rationalize experimental observations, is described using a mesoscale thermodynamic approach of the nucleation mechanism.           ,              The mechanisms involved in the formation/dissociation of methane hydrate confined at the nanometer scale are unraveled using advanced molecular modeling techniques combined with a mesoscale thermodynamic approach. Using atom-scale simulations probing coexistence upon confinement and free energy calculations, phase stability of confined methane hydrate is shown to be restricted to a narrower temperature and pressure domain than its bulk counterpart. The melting point depression at a given pressure, which is consistent with available experimental data, is shown to be quantitatively described using the Gibbs--Thomson formalism if used with accurate estimates for the pore/liquid and pore/hydrate interfacial tensions. The metastability barrier upon hydrate formation and dissociation is found to decrease upon confinement, therefore providing a molecular-scale picture for the faster kinetics observed in experiments on confined gas hydrates. By considering different formation mechanisms---bulk homogeneous nucleation, external surface nucleation, and confined nucleation within the porosity---we identify a cross-over in the nucleation process; the critical nucleus formed in the pore corresponds either to a hemispherical cap or to a bridge nucleus depending on temperature, contact angle, and pore size. Using the classical nucleation theory, for both mechanisms, the typical induction time is shown to scale with the pore volume to surface ratio and hence the pore size. These findings for the critical nucleus and nucleation rate associated with such complex transitions provide a means to rationalize and predict methane hydrate formation in any porous media from simple thermodynamic data.},

An equation of state for the cut and shifted LJ fluid is presented and compared with the simulation data of this work, and previously published Gibbs ensemble data. The MBWR equation of state can be extended to mixtures via the van der Waals one-fluid theory mixing rules.

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen--oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions.

Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

Here, we report a joint experimental and molecular simulation study of such electrolytes obtained by mixing 1-butyl 3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate with lithium tetrafluoroborate. More in detail, experiments consisting of X-ray scattering, pulsed field gradient NMR, and complex impedance spectroscopy are analyzed in the light of molecular dynamics simulations to probe the structural, dynamical, and electrochemical properties of this ionic-liquid-based electrolyte. Lithium addition promotes the nanostructuration of the liquid as evidenced from the appearance of a scattering prepeak that becomes more pronounced. Microscopically, using the partial structure factors determined from molecular dynamics, this prepeak is shown to correspond to the formation of well-ordered positive/negative charge series and also large aggregates (Lin(BF4)4--m)(4--m+n)--, which develop upon lithium addition. Such nanoscale ordering entails a drastic decrease in both the molecular mobility and ionic conductivity. In particular, the marked association of Li+ cations with four BF4-- anions and long ion pairing times, which are promoted upon lithium addition, are found to severely hinder the Li+ transport properties.},

  abstract = {In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, an accurate evaluation of temperature is essential for controlling temperature as well as pressure in the isothermal--isobaric conditions. According to the Tolman's equipartition theorem, all motions of all particles should share a single temperature. However, conventional temperature estimation from kinetic energy does not include Hessian terms properly, and thereby, the equipartition theorem is not satisfied with a large time step. In this paper, we show how to evaluate temperature the most accurately without increasing computational cost. We define two kinds of kinetic energies, evaluated at full- and half-time steps that underestimate or overestimate temperature, respectively. A combination of these two kinetic energies provides an optimal instantaneous temperature up to the third order of the time step. The method is tested for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, pure water molecules, a Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) protein in water molecules, and a hydrated 1,2-dispalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayer in water molecules. In all tests, the optimal temperature estimator fulfills the equipartition theorem better than existing methods and reproduces well the usual physical properties for time steps up to and including 5 fs.},

It therefore forms the basis for all molecular dynamics simulations of biological phenomena, as well as for many chemical, industrial, and materials investigations.

Here, we report a comprehensive comparison of structural and dynamic properties of 30 commonly used 3-point, 4-point, 5-point, and polarizable water models simulated using consistent settings and analysis methods. For the properties of density, coordination number, surface tension, dielectric constant, self-diffusion coefficient, and solvation free energy of methane, models published within the past two decades consistently show better agreement with experimental values compared to models published earlier, albeit with some notable exceptions. However, no single model reproduced all experimental values exactly, highlighting the need to carefully choose a water model for a particular study, depending on the phenomena of interest. Finally, machine learning algorithms quantified the relationship between the water model force field parameters and the resulting bulk properties, providing insight into the parameter-property relationship and illustrating the challenges of developing a water model that can accurately reproduce all properties of water simultaneously.},

The cut off distance for Ar was 3.5{$\sigma$} . We employed a molecular dynamics (MD) technique in which a pore space was connected with a bulk solution to easily determine the equilibrium bulk concentration. Liquid phase isotherms were obtained for pores with widths ranging from 5.5{$\sigma$} to 9.5{$\sigma$}, and the relation between the pore width and the phase separation concentration was determined. Each simulation was run until the bulk concentration attained equilibrium (1--2 {$\mu$}s). The MD results show that the Patrick model overestimates the bulk concentration for a given pore size. We proposed a modified Patrick model in which the pore wall potential is considered. In our model, the Gibbs-Tolman-Koenig-Buff effect is not considered for the interfacial tension since two surfaces of tension exist on both sides of the equimolar dividing surface of the two-Ar liquid phase. The two surfaces of tension neutralized Gibbs-Tolman-Koenig-Buff effect each other. The present simple model successfully describes the relation to prove its reliability.},

  abstract = {The transport properties and electrochemical stability of advanced lithiummetal batteries are severely con\- strained by the actual electrolyte compositions. Herein, for comprehensive atomistic insights and the develop\- ment of electrolyte scientific theory, molecular dynamics technology is employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of recently attractive poly(1,3-dioxolane)-based electrolytes and their interfaces with lithium metal. This work elaborates on the characteristics of Li+ solvation environments and the effects of polymer chain length or plasticizer content on the experiment-concerned properties of bulk electrolytes, including solvation sheath structures, ionic diffusions, conductivities, transport numbers, etc. Meanwhile, to clarify the influence of polymer or salt concentration on the electrolyte/lithium metal interface, three distinctive interface models were proposed and analyzed based on different electrolyte compositions in this work: liquidbased, polymer-based, and highly-concentrated systems. Compared with the unfavorable liquid interface layer in the liquid-based system, the latter two systems have more electrochemically stable interfacial construction due to the appearance of polymer on the lithium metal surface. Besides, the Li+ solvation structure, which is related to the lithium electrodeposition, exhibits orientation, e.g., small organic liquid molecules in the liquid-based system are more likely to appear on the side that is accessible to the lithium metal surface. These small mole\- cules are essentially excluded from the Li+ solvation structures in the polymer-based electrolyte, which is another important factor for stabilizing the interface. Furthermore, compared with the bulk electrolytes, it is found that ionic conductions at the interfaces are not attenuated in all systems. This work presents a comprehensive, profound view from bulk to interfacial properties, thus providing a theoretical cornerstone for the composition design and performance optimization of polymer electrolytes for lithium metal batteries.},

  abstract = {We present a combined experimental and theoretical study aimed at understanding the behavior of polar probe ethanol on graphene and graphite hydrophobic surfaces. We measured isosteric adsorption enthalpies and entropies by inverse gas chromatography for coverages ranging from 0.1 to 20\%. The adsorption enthalpies were found to vary with surface coverage and differed considerably between the materials at low coverage. However, they approached the same adsorption enthalpy value of -12.0 {\textpm} 0.4 kcal/mol for T centered at 303-393 K and coverages above 5\%. We explained the observed behavior using molecular dynamics simulations by employing empirical force-field and density functional theory calculations on two graphene models: circumcoronene and infinite graphene. The simulations showed that various hydrogen-bonded ethanol clusters formed spontaneously from isolated ethanol molecules on graphene and provided a distribution of cluster sizes. Nonlocal density functional theory was used to calculate adsorption enthalpies for various sizes of ethanol clusters. A theoretical adsorption enthalpy of -11.6 kcal/mol at 340 K was obtained from the weighted average of the cluster size distribution, while the adsorption enthalpy of single ethanol molecule to graphene was -6.3 kcal/mol at 323 K.},

We describe the subtle differences in molecular organization that result in the observed differences in the VSF spectra for methanol and ethanol at the alcohol-silica interface. Alcohol molecules hydrogen-bonded to the silica surface induce orientational opposition in an adjacent low-population region, which implies VSF signal reduction. This low population region is essentially of zero density in the ethanol system, implying less signal cancelation. Simulated silica defect sites increase the population of this region in both systems. Interestingly, the induced orientation in this region influences subsequent molecular orientation only in the ethanol-silica system, preserving the interfacial anisotropy. These effects suggest a stronger VSF response from the ethanol-silica system versus the methanol-silica system, where more methanol molecules reside in the low-population region, and this region does not induce order in subsequent solvent layers.},

In a previous article [Kashefolgheta               et al.               ,               J. Chem. Theory.

For a set of               N               molecules that are all in the liquid state under ambient conditions, such a matrix encompasses               N               {\texttimes}               N               entries for                              considering each of the               N               molecules either as solute (A) or as solvent (B). In the quoted study, a cross-solvation matrix of 25 {\texttimes} 25 experimental                              value was introduced, considering 25 small molecules representative for alkanes, chloroalkanes, ethers, ketones, esters, alcohols, amines, and amides. This experimental data was used to compare the relative accuracies of four popular condensed-phase force fields, namely GROMOS-2016H66, OPLS-AA, AMBER-GAFF, and CHARMM-CGenFF. In the present work, the comparison is extended to five additional force fields, namely GROMOS-54A7, GROMOS-ATB, OPLS-LBCC, AMBER-GAFF2, and OpenFF. Considering these nine force fields, the correlation coefficients between experimental values and simulation results range from 0.76 to 0.88, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) from 2.9 to 4.8 kJ mol               -1               , and average errors (AVEEs) from -1.5 to +1.0 kJ mol               -1               . In terms of RMSEs, GROMOS-2016H66 and OPLS-AA present the best accuracy (2.9 kJ mol               -1               ), followed by OPLS-LBCC, AMBER-GAFF2, AMBER-GAFF, and OpenFF (3.3 to 3.6 kJ mol               -1               ), and then by GROMOS-54A7, CHARM-CGenFF, and GROMOS-ATB (4.0 to 4.8 kJ mol               -1               ). These differences are statistically significant but not very pronounced, and are distributed rather heterogeneously over the set of compounds within the different force fields.},

  abstract = {The calculation of free-energy differences is one of the main challenges in computational biology and biochemistry. Umbrella sampling, biased molecular dynamics (MD), is one of the methods that provide free energy along a reaction coordinate. Here, the method is derived in a historic overview and is compared with related methods like thermodynamic integration, slow growth, steered MD, or the Jarzynski-based fast-growth technique. In umbrella sampling, bias potentials along a (one- or more-dimensional) reaction coordinate drive a system from one thermodynamic state to another (e.g., reactant and product). The intermediate steps are covered by a series of windows, at each of which an MD simulation is performed. The bias potentials can have any functional form. Often, harmonic potentials are used for their simplicity. From the sampled distribution of the system along the reaction coordinate, the change in free energy in each window can be calculated. The windows are then combined by methods like the weighted histogram analysis method or umbrella integration. If the bias potential is adapted to result in an even distribution between the end states, then this whole range can be spanned by one window (adaptive-bias umbrella sampling). In this case, the free-energy change is directly obtained from the bias. The sampling in each window can be improved by replica exchange methods; either by exchange between successive windows or by running additional simulations at higher temperatures. {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

  abstract = {Beyond well-documented confinement and surface effects arising from the large internal surface and severely confining porosity of nanoporous hosts, the transport of nanoconfined fluids remains puzzling in many aspects. With striking examples such as memory, i.e., non-viscous effects, intermittent dynamics, and surface barriers, the dynamics of fluids in nanoconfinement challenge classical formalisms (e.g., random walk, viscous/advective transport)---especially for molecular pore sizes. In this context, while molecular frameworks such as intermittent Brownian motion, free volume theory, and surface diffusion are available to describe the self-diffusion of a molecularly confined fluid, a microscopic theory for collective diffusion (i.e., permeability), which characterizes the flow induced by a thermodynamic gradient, is lacking. Here, to fill this knowledge gap, we invoke the concept of ``De Gennes narrowing,'' which relates the wavevectordependent collective diffusivity D0(q) to the fluid structure factor S(q). First, using molecular simulation for a simple yet representative fluid confined in a prototypical solid (zeolite), we unravel an essential coupling between the wavevector-dependent collective diffusivity and the structural ordering imposed on the fluid by the crystalline nanoporous host. Second, despite this complex interplay with marked Bragg peaks in the fluid structure, the fluid collective dynamics is shown to be accurately described through De Gennes narrowing. Moreover, in contrast to the bulk fluid, the departure from De Gennes narrowing for the confined fluid in the macroscopic limit remains small as the fluid/solid interactions in severe confinement screen collective effects and, hence, weaken the wavevector dependence of collective transport.},

Two-phase LB simulations are performed with modeled porous geometries that imitate multi-layer porous transport layers (PTLs) consisting of an MPL and a GDL. The simulation conditions are closely matched to the actual liquid water transport conditions in the PEMFCs. The results indicate that invasion-percolation processes due to strong capillary effects govern liquid water transport in PEMFCs. In addition, LB simulations are conducted by varying the intrusion thickness of the MPL and the surface wettability of the PTL. The results clearly show that the liquid water content can be reduced in the PTL by employing a thicker MPL and/or more hydrophobic surfaces. The steady-state water distribution is observed to occur more rapidly as the MPL becomes thicker or as the solid surfaces become more hydrophobic. Furthermore, several dynamic liquid water transport behaviors are identified from the results and explained in detail.},

  abstract = {Preserving the correct dynamics at the coarse-grained (CG) level is a pressing problem in the development of systematic CG models in soft matter simulation. Starting from the seminal idea of simple time-scale mapping, there have been many efforts over the years toward establishing a meticulous connection between the CG and fine-grained (FG) dynamics based on fundamental statistical mechanics approaches. One of the most successful attempts in this context has been the development of CG models based on the Mori--Zwanzig (MZ) theory, where the resulting equation of motion has the form of a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) and closely preserves the underlying FG dynamics. In this Review, we describe some of the recent studies in this regard. We focus on the construction and simulation of dynamically consistent systematic CG models based on the GLE, both in the simple Markovian limit and the non-Markovian case. Some recent studies of physical effects of memory are also discussed. The Review is aimed at summarizing recent developments in the field while highlighting the major challenges and possible future directions.},

  abstract = {The industries discharge a variety of pollutants, such as heavy metals, organic toxins, and oils, in water resources. Exposure of these contaminants in water causes adverse health effects on various forms of life. Novel materials are needed for the effective removal of pollutants from industrial wastewater. Graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets are promising materials for removal of organic pollutants. In this work, the suitability of the sheets for the separation of the ethanol-water mixture is investigated by studying the adsorption and structural behavior of ethanol-water mixtures in slit pores with variable width (7-13 {\AA}) using molecular dynamics simulations. The selectivity of ethanol is found to depend on the pore-width and nature of the pore walls. The selectivity of ethanol is highest for 9 {\AA} pores and lowest for 7 {\AA} pores, irrespective of the nature of the pore walls. However, selectivity of ethanol is relatively higher for hBN pores compared to the graphene pores, for all the considered pore widths. At a lower pore width, molecular sieving plays an important role for selective adsorption of ethanol molecules. On the other hand, at a higher pore width, selective adsorption of ethanol molecules is affected by the nature of the pore walls. The diffusion coefficients of water and ethanol molecules substantially decrease with a decrease in pore width for both graphene and hBN surfaces. The resident time of water and ethanol molecules decreases with increase in the slit-width. Furthermore, water and ethanol molecules confined in hBN pores show higher residence time and lower diffusion coefficient values compared to graphene pores. The adsorption behavior of water and ethanol molecules in the slit pores are analyzed using the potential mean forces, for water and ethanol molecules on the graphene and hBN surfaces, which are determined by umbrella sampling technique.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic relaxation is useful for probing physical and chemical properties of liquids in porous media. Examples are given on high surface area porous materials including calibrated porous silica glasses, granular packings, plaster pastes, cement-based materials and natural porous materials, such as sandstone and carbonate rocks. Here, we outline our recent NMR relaxation work for these very different porous materials. For instance, low field NMR relaxation of water in calibrated granular packings leads to striking different pore-size dependencies of the relaxation times T1 and T2 when changing the amount of surface paramagnetic impurities. This allows separation of the diffusion and surface limited regimes of relaxation in these macroporous media. The magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin--lattice relaxation rate 1/T1({$\omega$}0) is also a rich source of dynamical information for characterizing the molecular dynamics of liquids in porous media. This allows a continuous characterization of the evolving microstructure of various cementitious materials. Our recent applications of two-dimensional (2D) T1--T2 and T2-z-store-T2 correlation experiments have evidenced the water exchange in connected micropores of cement pastes. The direct probing of water adsorption time on a solid surface gives access to an original characterization of the surface nano-wettability of porous plaster pastes. We show that such a parameter depends directly on the physical chemistry of the pore surfaces. Lastly, we outline our recent measurements of wettability in oil/brine/reservoir carbonate rocks.},

This effect has been investigated experimentally using the protons of water adsorbed on paramagnetic charred sucrose. The dependence of the enhancement on the saturating microwave power is derived for the case of overlapping allowed and forbidden transitions, and predicts a linear change in polarization at low power levels. The general features of the enhancement found are in agreement with those predicted by perturbation theory using a simple dipole-dipole electron-nuclear interaction. However, the plot of log (polarization change) vs log (power) has a slope of 0.82{\textpm}0.04 instead of 1.0. In addition, the field separation between the points of maximum positive and maximum negative enhancement is too small in those chars for which inhomogeneous broadening is suspected.},

  abstract = {The use of CALF-20 for CO2 capture from humid flue gases has attracted a vast amount of attention from both academia and industry. The focus of this article is on CO2/H2O mixture adsorption for which published experimental data demonstrate the severe limitations of the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) in providing a quantitative estimation of the component loadings. We use Configurational-Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations for elucidating the origins of thermodynamic non-idealities. The CBMC simulations reveal that two distinct regimes prevail during mixture adsorption. For low relative humidities less than say 20~\%, the CO2 loadings in the adsorbed phase is significantly higher than anticipated by the IAST. CBMC simulations of intermolecular distances for guest pairs reveal that failure of the IAST can be traced to the phenomenon of segregated adsorption. The H2O-H2O pairs are close together at typical distances of about 3~{\AA}. The CO2-H2O pairs are typically 8~{\AA} apart, occupying adjacent adsorption sites corresponding to the O atoms of the oxalate group. This implies that the CO2 molecules face a less severe competitive adsorption with H2O than is anticipated by the IAST, whose applicability mandates a uniform and homogeneous distribution of adsorbates in pore space. The situation changes dramatically at high values of relative humidities, typically larger than about 50~\%; in this scenario, the adsorbed phase is significantly richer in H2O. The CO2 molecules are compelled to share same adsorption site with pairs of H2O molecules that are hydrogen-bonded with each other. Consequently, the competition faced by CO2 is significantly higher than anticipated by the IAST, resulting in significantly lower CO2 uptakes. The important message that emerges from this investigation is the need to incorporate the Real Adsorbed Solution Theory (RAST) for quantitative modelling of fixed-bed adsorbers in CO2 capture with CALF-20.},

  abstract = {An accurate model for the density of states (DOS) for strongly inhomogeneous and bulk fluids has been proposed based on {$\gamma$} distributions. The contribution to the density of states from the collective dynamics is modeled as an incomplete {$\gamma$} distribution and the high frequency region is obtained from the solution of the memory equation using a sech memory kernel. Using only the frequency moments as input, the model parameters for the collective dynamics are obtained by matching moments of the resulting distribution. The model results in an analytical expression for the self-diffusivity of the fluid. We present results for soft sphere fluids confined in slit-shaped pores as well as bulk soft sphere liquids. Comparisons of the DOS, velocity autocorrelation functions, and memory kernels with molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the model predicts features in the DOS over the entire frequency range and is able to capture changes in the DOS as a function of fluid density and temperature. As a result the predicted VACFs, memory kernels, and self-diffusivities are accurately predicted over a wide range of conditions. Since the frequency moments for bulk liquids can be obtained from pair correlation functions, our method provides a direct route from fluid structure to dynamics. For fluids confined in slit-shaped pores, where the frequency moments are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, the predicted self-diffusivities capture the resulting oscillations due to variations in the solvation pressure, and in the case of smooth walled pores, the predictions are superior to those obtained using kinetic theory.},

  abstract = {Proton spin-lattice relaxation times, T1, at 28 MHz by a recovery from saturation, are reported for very pure water between 0 and 100{$^\circ$}C. Our experimental T1 values for water are the longest values which have been observed. In this temperature region the most effective spin-lattice relaxation mechanism in water is by proton dipole-dipole intra- and intermolecular interactions modulated by thermal molecular motion. Measurements for water of dielectric relaxation, X ray diffraction, self diffusion, viscosity and slow neutron inelastic scattering are used in the interpretation of the proton T1 results. The intermolecular contribution to T-11 has been determined with the aid of X ray radial distribution curves and Hubbard's correction for the off-centre proton effect. There is excellent agreement between the temperature dependence of the experimental proton spin-lattice relaxation times and the reciprocals of the dielectric relaxation times. The ratio of the dielectric relaxation time to the molecular reorientation NMR correlation time is found independent of temperature and equal to 3.7 instead of the expected value, three. This result provides an evidence for a small value of the single jump angle in the Brownian reorientation of water molecules and may be accounted for by an internal field correction factor of 0.81. This compares with the value 0.69 obtained for water from the Powles formula.},

For all quantities considered, the classical liquid is the most structured while quantum H2O is the least structured.

The interface is modeled by a system of 384 water molecules for 125 ps in a two-dimensional periodic slab, the most extensive ab initio molecular dynamics simulation to date. In contrast to previous theoretical simulations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, but consistent with sum-frequency generation experiments, we observe no evidence for a significant occurrence of acceptoronly species at the vapor/water interface.

A good knowledge of the elastic properties of graphene is prerequisite to any practical application of it in nanoscopic devices. Although this two-dimensional material is only one atom thick, continuous-medium elasticity can be applied as long as the deformations vary slowly on the atomic scale and provided suitable parameters are used. The present paper aims to be a critical review on this topic that does not assume a specific pre-knowledge of graphene physics. The basis for the paper is the classical Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. It demands a few parameters that can be addressed from many points of view and fitted to independent experimental data. The parameters can also be estimated by electronic structure calculations. Although coming from diverse backgrounds, most of the available data provide a rather coherent picture that gives a good degree of confidence in the classical description of graphene elasticity. The theory can than be used to estimate, e.g., the buckling limit of graphene bound to a substrate. It can also predict the size above which a scrolled graphene sheet will never spontaneously unroll in free space.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out for liquid water between flat hydrophobic surfaces. The surfaces produce density oscillations that extend at least 10 {\AA} into the liquid, and significant molecular orientational preferences that extend at least 7 {\AA} into the liquid. The liquid structure nearest the surface is characterized by ``dangling'' hydrogen bonds; i.e., a typical water molecule at the surface has one potentially hydrogen-bonding group oriented toward the hydrophobic surface. This surface arrangement represents a balance between the tendencies of the liquid to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds on the one hand, and to maximize the packing density of the molecules on the other. A detailed analysis shows that the structural properties of the liquid farther from the surface can be understood as effects imposed by this surface structure. These results show that the hydration structure of large hydrophobic surfaces can be very different from that of small hydrophobic molecules.},

  abstract = {The confined dynamics of water molecules inside a pore involves an intermittence between adsorption steps near the interface and surface diffusion and excursions in the pore network. Depending on the strength of the interaction in the layer(s) close to the surface and the dynamical confinement of the distal bulk liquid, exchange dynamics can vary significantly. The average time spent in the surface proximal region (also called the adsorption layer) between a first entry and a consecutive exit allows estimating the level of `nanowettablity' of water. As shown in several seminal works, NMRD is an efficient experimental method to follow such intermittent dynamics close to an interface. In this paper, the intermittent dynamics of a confined fluid inside nanoporous materials is discussed. Special attention is devoted to the interplay between bulk diffusion, adsorption and surface diffusion on curved pore interfaces. Considering the nano or meso length scale confinement of the pore network, an analytical model for calculating the inter-dipolar spin--lattice relaxation dispersion curves is proposed. In the low-frequency regime (50 KHz--100 MHz), this model is successfully compared with numerical simulations performed using a 3D-off lattice reconstruction of Vycor glass. Comparison with experimental data available in the literature is finally discussed.},

  abstract = {Porous materials, concentrated colloidal suspensions are examples of confining systems developing large specific surface and presenting a rich variety of shapes. Such an interfacial confinement strongly influences the molecular dynamics of embedded fluids and the diffusive motion of entrapped Brownian particles. An individual trajectory near the interface can be described as an alternate succession of adsorption steps and random flights in the bulk. Statistical properties of these random flights in various interfacial confining systems are needed as prerequisites in order to understand the full transport process. Related to first passage processes, these properties play a central role in numerous problems such as the mean first exit time in a bounded domain, heterogeneous catalytic reactivity and nuclear magnetic relaxation in complex and biological fluids. In the present work, we first consider the various possibilities of connecting two points of a smooth interface by a random flight in the bulk. Second, we analyse from the theoretical and experimental points of view a way to probe Brownian flight statistics. From the experimental point of view, we investigate the slow fluid dynamics near some colloidal interfaces by field-cycling NMR relaxometry. This is a way to follow slow dynamical correlations from 1 ns to 10 {\textmu}s. This spectroscopy appears to be a good choice, considering that the algebraic nature of the probability of the first return to a surface builds a long-time memory. The experimental part confirms that the embedded fluid dynamics is sensitive to possible morphologic crossover and provides information about interface geometry. We also believe that such an approach can be used to probe interfacial dynamics by itself, for example in the case of a colloidal system undergoing a phase transition (dynamical arrest, rotational blockage, . . .).},

In the strong-adsorption regime, it was recently proposed that the effective surface diffusion on flat surface is anomalous and exhibits long-time pathology, enlarging the time domain of the embedded-fluid dynamics towards the low-frequency regime. An interesting way to probe such a slow interfacial process is to use the field-cycling NMR relaxometry. This technique is used here to probe the fluid dynamics in two types of interfacial systems: i) a colloidal glass made of thin and flat particles; ii) a fully saturated porous media, the Vycor glass. Experimental results are critically compared to either a simple theoretical model of NMR dispersion involving elementary steps of the fluid dynamics near an interface (loops, trains, tails) or Brownian-dynamics simulations performed inside 3D reconstructions of these confined systems.},

  abstract = {Water (H2O) is of great societal importance, and there has been a significant amount of research on its fundamental properties and related physical phenomena. Deuterium dioxide (D2O), known as heavy water, also draws much interest as an important medium for medical imaging, nuclear reactors, etc. Although many experimental studies on the fundamental properties of H2O and D2O have been conducted, they have been primarily limited to understanding the differences between H2O and D2O in the bulk state. In this paper, using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, the structural and dynamical properties of H2O and D2O in bulk and under nanoscale confinement in a (14,0) carbon nanotube are studied. We find that in bulk, structural properties such as bond angle and bond length of D2O are slightly smaller than those of H2O while D2O is slightly more structured than H2O. The dipole moment of D2O tends to be 4\% higher than that of H2O, and the hydrogen bonding of D2O is also stronger than that of H2O. Under nanoscale confinement in a (14,0) carbon nanotube, H2O and D2O exhibit a smaller bond length and bond angle. The hydrogen bond number decreases, which demonstrates a weakened hydrogen bond interaction. Moreover, confinement results in a lower libration frequency and a higher OH(OD) bond stretching frequency with an almost unchanged HOH(DOD) bending frequency. The D2O-filled (14,0) carbon nanotube is found to have a smaller radial breathing mode than the H2O-filled (14,0) carbon nanotube.},

Restoring details at a finer scale requires us to generate information following embedded physics and statistics of the models at two different levels of description. Techniques designed to address this persistent challenge balance among accuracy, efficiency, and general applicability. In this work, we present an image-based approach for structural backmapping from coarse-grained to atomistic models with cis-1,4 polyisoprene melts as an illustrative example. Through machine learning, we train conditional generative adversarial networks on the correspondence between configurations at the levels considered. The trained model is subsequently applied to provide predictions of atomistic structures from the input coarse-grained configurations. The effect of different data representation schemes on training and prediction quality is examined. Our proposed backmapping approach shows remarkable efficiency and transferability over different molecular weights in the melt based on training sets constructed from oligomeric compounds. We anticipate that this versatile backmapping approach can be readily extended to other complex systems to provide high-fidelity initial configurations with minimal human intervention.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a structurally simple and nontoxic water-soluble polymer that is widely used in medical and pharmaceutical applications as molecular linker and spacer. In such applications, PEG's elastic response against conformational deformations is key to its function. According to text-book knowledge, a polymer reacts to the stretching of its end-to-end separation by a decrease in entropy that is due to the reduction of available conformations, which is why polymers are commonly called entropic springs. By a combination of single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments with molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water, we show that entropic hydration effects almost exactly compensate the chain conformational entropy loss at high stretching. Our simulations reveal that this entropic compensation is due to the stretching-induced release of water molecules that in the relaxed state form double hydrogen bonds with PEG. As a consequence, the stretching response of PEG is predominantly of energetic, not of entropic, origin at high forces and caused by hydration effects, while PEG backbone deformations only play a minor role. These findings demonstrate the importance of hydration for the mechanics of macromolecules and constitute a case example that sheds light on the antagonistic interplay of conformational and hydration degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {The hydrophobic interaction is significantly responsible for driving protein folding and selfassembly. To understand it, the thermodynamics, the role of water structure, the dewetting process surrounding hydrophobes, and related aspects have undergone extensive investigations. Here, we examine the hypothesis that polymer-solvent interfacial free energy is adequate to describe the energetics of the collapse of a hydrophobic homopolymer chain at fixed temperature, which serves as a much simplified model for studying the hydrophobic collapse of a protein. This implies that changes in polymer-solvent interfacial free energy should be directly proportional to the force to extend a collapsed polymer into a bad solvent. To test this hypothesis, we undertook single-molecule force spectroscopy on a collapsed, single, polystyrene chain in water-ethanol and water-salt mixtures where we measured the monomer solvation free energy from an ensemble average conformations. Different proportions within the binary mixture were used to create solvents with different interfacial free energies with polystyrene. In these mixed solvents, we observed a linear correlation between the interfacial free energy and the force required to extend the chain into solution, which is a direct measure of the solvation free energy per monomer on a single chain at room temperature. A simple analytical model compares favorably with the experimental results. This knowledge supports a common assumption that explicit water solvent may not be necessary for cases whose primary concerns are hydrophobic interactions and hydrophobic hydration.},

However, ensuring the stability of supercritical CO2 foam systems under high temperature and pressure reservoir conditions remains a challenge. Note that the term "supercritical CO2 foam" specifically denotes a foam system created by combining an aqueous solution containing chemical additives with CO2 in a supercritical state under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Surfactants can reduce the surface Gibbs free energy by adsorbing onto the CO2-water interface to form a monolayer structure, which hinders CO2 diffusion and improves foam stability. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to analyze the adsorption behavior and interfacial performance of betaine surfactant BS12 and the anionic surfactant SDS at the CO2-water interface. The results indicate that BS12 can reduce interfacial tension more effectively at near-saturated concentrations. Moreover, the monolayer formed by BS12 has a lower voidage and wider interfacial thickness. The carboxyl-nitrogen interaction among BS12 molecules impedes their further aggregation, thereby maintaining the mutually perpendicular "L" orientation of the headgroup and hydrophobic tail thus forming a rigid and stable monolayer structure. Additionally, the spatial distribution function, radial distribution function, and hydrogen bond statistics indicate that although BS12 exhibits slightly weaker hydrophobicity than SDS, its hydrophobicity is less affected by concentration.},

In particular, the properties were determined at different SDS packing fractions, 0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%. The calculated interfacial tension, determined from the difference of normal and transverse components of the pressure tensor, was found to decrease with increasing SDS concentration at the methane/water interface, whereas the equilibrium partition of methane in the gas and water phases remained nearly unchanged. Both of these results were in quantitative agreement with experimental observations. The presence of SDS at the interface increased the free energy barrier of methane transport through the interface. Therefore, it was found that the rate of methane transport across the interface slowed down with increasing SDS concentrations. In other words, the thermodynamic driving force was unchanged, but the kinetic barrier was enhanced from 9.07 kJ/mol at 0\% SDS to 14.17 kJ/mol at 100\% SDS coverage at 260 K for the transport of methane to the aqueous phase.

  abstract = {We propose a general approach for determining the entropy and free energy of complex systems as a function of temperature and pressure. In this method the Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation function, obtained from a short (20 ps) molecular dynamics trajectory is used to obtain the vibrational density of states (DoS) which is then used to calculate the thermodynamic properties by applying quantum statistics assuming each mode is a harmonic oscillator. This approach is quite accurate for solids, but leads to significant errors for liquids where the DoS at zero frequency, S(0), remains finite. We show that this problem can be resolved for liquids by using a two phase model consisting of a solid phase for which the DoS goes to zero smoothly at zero frequency, as in a Debye solid; and a gas phase (highly fluidic), described as a gas of hard spheres. The gas phase component has a DoS that decreases monotonically from S(0) and can be characterized with two parameters: S(0) and 3Ng, the total number of gas phase modes [3Ng{$\rightarrow$}0 for a solid and 3Ng{$\rightarrow$}3(N-1) for temperatures and pressures for which the system is a gas]. To validate this two phase model for the thermodynamics of liquids, we applied it to pure Lennard-Jones systems for a range of reduced temperatures from 0.9 to 1.8 and reduced densities from 0.05 to 1.10. These conditions cover the gas, liquid, crystal, metastable, and unstable states in the phase diagram. Our results compare quite well with accurate Monte Carlo calculations of the phase diagram for classical Lennard-Jones particles throughout the entire phase diagram. Thus the two-phase thermodynamics approach provides an efficient means for extracting thermodynamic properties of liquids (and gases and solids).},

As chloride permeates the interface, a water finger forms and breaks at a chloride separation of\,{$\approx$}\,2.8\,nm from the Gibbs dividing surface. For larger separations from the interface, about 7 water molecules are estimated to stay bound to chloride in saturated water vapor, as corroborated by continuum dielectrics and statistical mechanics models. This ion hydration significantly reduces the free-energy barrier for evaporation. The effective chloride diffusivity in the transition state is found to be about 6 times higher than in bulk, which reflects the highly mobile hydration dynamics as the water finger breaks. Both effects significantly increase the chloride evaporation flux from the quiescent interface of an electrolyte solution, which is predicted from reaction kinetic theory.},

We use a global optimization procedure to develop water-model-transferable force fields for the ions K+, Na+, Cl--, and Br-- in the complete parameter space of all Lennard-Jones interactions using standard mixing rules. No extra-thermodynamic assumption is necessary for the simultaneous optimization of the four ion pairs. After an optimization with respect to the experimental solvation free energy and activity, the force fields reproduce the concentration-dependent density, ionic conductivity, and dielectric constant with high accuracy. The force field is fully transferable between simple point charge/extended and transferable intermolecular potential water models. Our results show that a thermodynamically consistent force field for these ions needs only Lennard-Jones and standard Coulomb interactions.},

Here, a quantitative analysis of wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) profiles was conducted for the first time on a series of mixtures of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI), PEO/LiTFSI, as a function of salt concentration in the melt state. Abnormal scattering signatures were observed: while WAXS data showed a single peak (Peak 1) in the absence of salt, a second peak (Peak 0) appeared at lower scattering angles with added salt. Molecular dynamics simulations with the standard TraPPE-UA force field were used to uncover the molecular origins of the WAXS peaks. Qualitative agreement was found between the experimental and simulated scattering profiles. Simulations indicated that Peak 1 arises from correlations between EO segments as well as correlations between TFSI- ions and EO segments, while Peak 0 arises from correlations between neighboring TFSI- ions. There were, however, quantitative disagreements between experiment and simulations, which were resolved by the introduction of a charge rescaling factor, Rf, to account for the polarization of ions and polymers. Simulations with charge rescaling predicted that the formation of anion-rich clusters occurs at a higher salt concentration than the emergence of Peak 0. While the WAXS data did not directly reflect the presence of anion-rich clusters, they provided a basis for more refined calculation of short-range correlations between ions, correlations that directly affect clustering and ion-transport properties such as ionic conductivities and transference numbers.},

The analytical prediction compares closely with ab initio energy calculations. Pure bending of graphene monolayers into cylindrical tubes is simulated by a molecular mechanics approach, showing slight nonlinearity and anisotropy in the tangent bending modulus as the bending curvature increases.

Even for the highly concentrated 1 DMSO\,:\,2 H2O solution, the water hydrogen--hydrogen radial distribution function, gHH(r), exhibits the characteristic tetrahedral ordering of water--water hydrogen bonds. Structural information is further obtained from various partial atom--atom distribution functions, not accessible experimentally. The behavior of water radial distribution functions, gOO(r) and gOH(r) indicate that the nearest neighbor correlations among remaining water molecules in the mixture increase with increasing DMSO concentration. No preferential association of methyl groups on DMSO is detected. The pattern of hydrogen bonding and the distribution of hydrogen bond lifetimes in the simulated mixtures is further investigated. Molecular dynamics results show that DMSO typically forms two hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Hydrogen bonds between DMSO and water molecules are longer lived than water--water hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond lifetimes determined by reactive flux correlation function approach are about 5 and 3 ps for water--DMSO and water--water pairs, respectively, in 1 DMSO\,:\,2 H2O mixture. In contrast, for pure water, the hydrogen bond lifetime is about 1 ps. We discuss these times in light of experimentally determined rotational relaxation times. The relative values of the hydrogen bond lifetimes are consistent with a statistical (i.e., transition state theory) interpretation.},

  abstract = {Driven by physical questions pertaining to quantifying particle dynamics, microscopy can now resolve complex systems at the single-particle level, from cellular organisms to individual ions. Yet, available analysis techniques face challenges reconstructing trajectories in dense and heterogeneous systems where accurately labeling particles is difficult. Furthermore, the inescapable finite field of view of experiments hinders the measurement of collective effects. Inspired by Smoluchowski, we introduce a broadly applicable analysis technique that probes dynamics of interacting particle suspensions based on a remarkably simple principle: counting particles in finite observation boxes. Using colloidal experiments, advanced simulations, and theory, we first demonstrate that statistical properties of fluctuating counts can be used to determine self-diffusion coefficients, so alleviating the hurdles associated with trajectory reconstruction. We also provide a recipe for practically extracting the diffusion coefficient from experimental data at variable particle densities, which is sensitive to steric and hydrodynamic interactions. Remarkably, by increasing the observation box size, counting naturally enables the study of collective dynamics in dense suspensions. Using our novel analysis of particle counts, we uncover a surprising enhancement of collective behavior due to hydrodynamics as well as a new length scale which can be connected with hyperuniform structure. Our counting framework, the ``countoscope,'' thus enables efficient measurements of self and collective dynamics in dense suspensions and opens the way to quantifying dynamics and identifying novel physical mechanisms in diverse complex systems where single particles can be resolved.

  abstract = {Carbon mitigation is one challenging issue that the world is facing. To tackle the deleterious impacts of CO2, processes emerged, including chemisorption from amine-based solvents and, more recently, physisorption in nanoporous solids. Physisorption in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is currently attracting considerable attention; however, the selection of the optimum sorbent is still challenging. While CO2 adsorption by MOFs has been widely explored from a thermodynamics standpoint, dynamical aspects remain less explored. CALF-20(Zn) MOF was recently proposed as a promising alternative to the commercially used CO2 13X zeolite sorbents; however, an in-depth understanding of the nanoscopic mechanisms originating its good performance still has to be achieved. To do so, we deliver some insights into the adsorption and diffusion of CO2, H2O, and mixtures in CALF-20 through atomistic simulations. CALF-20(Zn) was revealed to exhibit unconventional guest-host behaviors that give rise to abnormal guest thermodynamics and dynamics. The hydrophobic nature of the nanoporous solid leads to a low water adsorption enthalpy at low loading, followed by a continuous increase, driven by strong water hydrogen bonds, found to arrange as quasi 1D molecular wires in MOF nanoporosity, recalling water behavior in smalldiameter carbon nanotubes. While no superdiffusion was found in the CALF-20(Zn) as compared to carbon nanotubes, this behavior was shown to impact the guest-loading diffusion coefficient profile, with the presence of a minimum that correlates with the inflection point in the adsorption isotherm corresponding to the H2O wires formation. Interestingly, the diffusion coefficients of CO2 and H2O were also found to be of the same order of magnitude, with similar nonlinear profiles as a function of the guest loading. We further demonstrated that the diffusion coefficient for CO2 in the presence of water decreases with increasing water loading.},

The ATB has three primary functions: (1) to act as a repository for molecules that have been parametrized as part of the GROMOS family of force fields, (2) to act as a repository for pre-equilibrated systems for use as starting configurations in molecular dynamics simulations (solvent mixtures, lipid systems pre-equilibrated to adopt a specific phase, etc.), and (3) to generate force field descriptions of novel molecules compatible with the GROMOS family of force fields in a variety of formats (GROMOS, GROMACS, and CNS). Force field descriptions of novel molecules are derived using a multistep process in which results from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are combined with a knowledge-based approach to ensure compatibility (as far as possible) with a specific parameter set of the GROMOS force field. The ATB has several unique features: (1) It requires that the user stipulate the protonation and tautomeric states of the molecule. (2) The symmetry of the molecule is analyzed to ensure that equivalent atoms are assigned identical parameters. (3) Charge groups are assigned automatically. (4) Where the assignment of a given parameter is ambiguous, a range of possible alternatives is provided. The ATB also provides several validation tools to assist the user to assess the degree to which the topology generated may be appropriate for a given task. In addition to detailing the steps involved in generating a force field topology compatible with a specific GROMOS parameter set (GROMOS 53A6), the challenges involved in the automatic generation of force field parameters for atomic simulations in general are discussed.},

The competition between elasticity and tension is known to cause a buckling instability in filaments placed near hyperbolic stagnation points and the effect of thermal fluctuations on this transition has yet to receive full quantitative treatment. Motivated by the findings of recent experiments as well as our simulations, we solve for the amplitude of the first buckled mode near the onset of the instability. This reveals a stochastic supercritical bifurcation, which is in excellent agreement with full numerical simulations.},

By systematic studies, three distinct causes are elucidated: (i) an unfortunate choice of reference points for the umbrella distance restraint; (ii) a misfit in probability distributions between bound and unbound umbrella windows in case of multiple binding modes; (iii) artifacts introduced by the free energy estimator. Starting with a fully symmetric model system consisting of methane binding to a cylindrical host, complexity is increased through the introduction of dipolar interactions between the host and the solvent, the host and the guest molecule or between all involved species, respectively. The manifestation of artifacts is illustrated and their origin and prevention is discussed. Finally, the consequences for the calculation of standard binding free enthalpies is illustrated using the complexation of primary alcohols with {$\alpha$}-cyclodextrin as an example.},

Here, we develop a framework that will enable workable predictions of permeate flux and composition in complex hydrocarbon liquids through intrinsically porous glassy polymers. The predictions are made by incorporating experimentally-derived unary sorption and diffusion parameters in a Maxwell-Stefan framework coupled with multicomponent sorption models and various distinct diffusion phenomena. Across the range of sorption and diffusion phenomena considered, both the conventional Flory-Huggins model and the proposed Langmuir~+~Flory-Huggins sorption model combined with a simple average guest diffusivity or a more complex free-volume theory-based transport resulted in the lowest prediction error for three chosen multicomponent separations. The proposed Maxwell-Stefan framework simply requires pure component transport parameters to allow a fast approximation of the separation of multicomponent liquid hydrocarbon feeds that can potentially be extended to more complex feeds such as crude oil fractions.},

Conventionally, the approximation of subtracting from the atom DOF by 1/2 per one distance constraint has been used, but this approximation is valid for spatially homogeneous systems only. In the present study, on the basis of statistical mechanics, we derived more general expressions for the DOF of atoms in fully or partially rigid molecules. The expressions ensure that in an equilibrium state, all constrained atoms have the same temperature as the equilibrium temperature of the whole system and are also applicable to inhomogeneous systems.},

  abstract = {The light and heavy liquid water (H2O--D2O) mixtures in the 0--1 molar fraction were studied in the mid-infrared by Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. Five principal factors were retrieved by factor analysis (FA). When D2O is mixed with H2O, the HDO formed because of the hopping nature of the proton (H or D) results in three types of molecules in equilibrium. Because of the nearest-neighbor interactions, the three molecules give rise to nine species. Some of the species evolve concomitantly with other species giving the five principal factors observed. We present the spectra of these factors with their abundances. The calculated probability of the species present at different molar fractions which when the concomitant species are combined gives the observed abundances. To appreciate clearly the difference between the principal spectra, a Gaussian simulation of the bands was made. Because of the numerous components that make up the stretch bands, they are not very sensitive to changes in composition of the solutions; nevertheless, they do indicate the presence of new entities other than the pure species. The deformation bands, more sensitive to such changes than the stretch bands, clearly indicate the presence of the three types of molecules as well as of intermediate species. These bands are sensitive to the two hydrogen bonds on the oxygen atom that a reference molecule makes with its nearest-neighbors, but not to the hydrogen bonds that the nearest-neighbors make with the next nearest neighbors.},

Here, we study the ethanol-water blend confined between the mica and single or multilayer graphene for different slit pore widths, ethanol content, and temperatures. Our molecular dynamics simulation indicates that water molecules are adsorbed at the mica surface, while ethanol molecules prefer to be adsorbed near the graphene surface. We find that distinct layers of ethanol molecules form as the channel width and ethanol content in the mixture are increased. The diffusion of confined ethanol and water molecules depends on the nanopore widths, concentrations, and temperatures. Interestingly, at nanopore widths of 1.0 and 1.3 nm, the mobility of confined ethanol molecules is greater than that of water molecules for all ethanol concentrations. In contrast, at pore width of 0.7 nm, the opposite behavior is observed at lower concentrations of ethanol (xEtOH = 0.1 and 0.3) in the mixture. Furthermore, the diffusivity of ethanol and water in the mixtures increases with increasing the temperatures. The hydrogen bond and cluster analysis imply the segregation of water molecules near the mica surface, while ethanol molecules are near the opposite pore wall (graphene).},

  abstract = {New ultrasonic and hypersonic measurements of the speed of sound in aqueous ethanol mixtures are presented, particularly in the temperature and ethanol-concentration domains of the maximum of sound. Molecular Dynamics studies indicate that these mixtures show aggregation of ethanol molecules in the low ethanol mole fraction x b 0.2, bicontinuous-like phase around x = 0.5, and weak water clustering above x = 0.8. The resulting micro-heterogeneity is seen to affect the long range part of all the correlation functions of the aggregating species. Nevertheless, simulation results help understanding the general trends seen in the experimental results: it is the structural change between ethanol's clustering and water-ethanol microsegregation that corresponds to the maximum observed in the speed of sound around x = 0.15.},

  abstract = {Ionizable groups tethered to a polymer backbone often associate to form ionic clusters, whose features are determined by the balance of the polymer backbone and electrostatics. These assemblies impact the dynamics of the macromolecules and their ability to transport ions. Here, using fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate the effects of the distribution of ionizable groups along the polymer backbone on cluster characteristics and the resulting impacts on the structure and dynamics of amorphous polymers. Particularly, we probe polystyrene sulfonates (PSS) with random, precise, and block configurations of the SO3- sulfonate groups along the backbone with Na+ as the counterion. We find that the distribution of the ionic groups affects the shape and distribution of the clusters as well as the internal packing of the ionizable groups in the cluster and the number of unique chains that participate in each cluster, affecting the structure and the dynamics of the polymers. The signature of ionic clusters, observed in the static structure factor S(q) for all three distributions, is significantly more pronounced for the precise and blocky polymers compared to the random one. Remarkably, we find that the local mobility of the polymer segments is not only affected by the number and size of the clusters but also by the number of polymer chains associated with clusters.},

We use molecular dynamics simulations to model the solid amorphous polymer electrolyte system comprising poly(ethylene) oxide (PEO), lithium, and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide anion (TFSI), exploring effects of high salt concentrations relevant for battery applications. Using statistical analysis of ion distribution and transport, we investigate the significant effect that salt concentration has on ion mobility. At practical salt concentrations, a previously undetected ensemble of Li-TFSI clusters emerges where Li ions have significantly lower coordination by the polymer, and this results in their significantly lower mobility as compared to Li ions coordinated by the polymer. We also find the tendency for cation-anion clusters to be asymmetrical, with the anions in greater number than Li cations, which may further affect the transport properties of this material. The existence of such negatively charged clusters has been recently speculated to explain the experimentally observed negative transference number at high LiTFSI concentrations in PEO. Our methodology enables us to suggest strategies for improvement of transport properties and can be generalized to other polymer- Li-salt combinations.},

  abstract = {We observe, by computer simulations, a remarkable long-distance, rare, but repetitive, exchange of ethanol molecules between two parallel graphene surfaces in nanoconfined, aqueous, ethanol solutions. We compute the rate of exchange as a function of the separation (d) between the two surfaces. We discover that the initiating (or, the launching) step in this exchange is the attainment of an instantaneous orientation of the carbon--oxygen bond vector relative to the graphene surface. This observation led us to construct a two-dimensional free energy surface for this exchange, with respect to two order parameters, namely, (i) the perpendicular distance of ethanol molecule from the graphene surfaces, z, and (ii) the orientation of the O--C bond vector, {\texttheta}, of the tagged ethanol molecule. For d = 3~nm, the rate of exchange is found to be 0.44~ns               -1               for the force field used. We also vary the force field and determine the sensitivity of the rate. From the free energy landscape, one could determine the minimum energy pathway. We use both, the transition state theory and Kramers' theory, to calculate the rate. The calculated rate agrees well with the simulated value as mentioned above. We find that the rate of exchange phenomenon is sensitive to the interaction strength of graphene and the hydrophobic group of ethanol. The free energy landscape exchange shows dependence on the distance separation of the two hydrophobic surfaces and reveals interesting features.},

In this way, the new M-S formulation explicitly considers effects of intrinsic MMM features such as finite filler particle size and isotherm nonlinearity in the MMM constituent phases, as well as mixture-related effects, such as competitive adsorption and friction amongst permeants, on the calculation of the mixture fluxes (permeabilities). This is achieved without introduction of empirical fitting parameters in the MMM permeability calculation and only requiring single-gas experimental or simulation-based adsorption and permeation data on the individual MMM materials to predict the mixture perm-selectivity in the MMM as a whole. Further, we validate the new approach by using available experimental permeation data for the separation of an equimolar binary mixture of propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) in ZIF-8/PIM-6FDA-OH MMMs, with the rigorous simulation results showing very good agreement with both experimental single and mixed-gas permeabilities and perm-selectivities.},

A bulk-like liquid in the core of the pore and a distinct interfacial region near the pore surface have been identified based on ortho-positronium lifetime components. The lifetime corresponding to the core liquid shows similar behavior to the bulk liquid mixture while the interfacial lifetime shows an abrupt rise within a particular range of ethanol concentration depending on the pore size. This abrupt increase is attributed to the appearance of excess free-volume near the interfacial region. The excess free-volume is originated due to microphase separation of confined ethanol--water primarily at the vicinity of the pore wall. We envisage that probing free-volume changes at the interface using PALS is a sensitive way to investigate microphase separation under nanoconfinement.},

The simulations are used to study the dynamic equilibrium of the gases at the water--gas interface, to determine the z-density profiles for the gases and water, and calculate the interfacial tension {$\gamma$} under the different temperature/pressure conditions close to those of the formation of clathrate hydrates of these gases. At the same hydrostatic gas phase pressure, the CO2--water interface has a lower interfacial tension than the CH4--water interface. A greater number of CO2 molecules, as much as three times more than methane at the same pressure, were adsorbed at the interfacial layer, which reflects the stronger electrostatic quadrupolar and van der Waals interactions between CO2 and water molecules at the interface. The water surfaces are covered by less than a monolayer of gas even when the pressure of the system goes near the saturation pressure of CO2. The surface adsorbed molecules are in dynamic equilibrium with the bulk gas and with exchange between the gas and interface regions occurring repeatedly within the timescale of the simulations. The effects of the changes in the CO2--water interfacial tension with external temperature and pressure conditions on the formation of the clathrate hydrates and other CO2 capture and sequestration processes are discussed.},

In the case of a finite number of particles, the particle energy distribution was obtained by Boltzmann in 1868. However, it appears that this distribution is not valid for all vessels. A round vessel is a special case due to the additional integral of motion, the conservation of the gas angular momentum. This paper is intended to fill this gap, it provides the exact distribution of particle energy for a classical non-rotating ideal gas of a finite number of colliding particles in a round vessel. This previously unknown distribution was obtained analytically from the first principles, it includes the dependence on all the particle masses. The exact mean energies of gas particles are also found to depend on the system parameters, i.e., the distribution of energy over the degrees of freedom is not uniform. Therefore, the usual ideal gas model allows for the uneven energy partitioning, which we study here both theoretically and in simple numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {The transport of fluid and ions in nano/molecular confinements is the governing physics of a myriad of embodiments in nature and technology including human physiology, plants, energy modules, water collection and treatment systems, chemical processes, materials synthesis, and medicine. At nano/molecular scales, the confinement dimension approaches the molecular size and the transport characteristics deviates significantly from that at macro/micro scales. A thorough understanding of physics of transport at these scales and associated fluid properties is undoubtedly critical for future technologies. This compressive review provides an elaborate picture on the promising future applications of nano/molecular transport, highlights experimental and simulation metrologies to probe and comprehend this transport phenomenon, discusses the physics of fluid transport, tunable flow by orders of magnitude, and gating mechanisms at these scales, and lists the advancement in the fabrication methodologies to turn these transport concepts into reality. Properties such as chain-like liquid transport, confined gas transport, surface charge-driven ion transport, physical/chemical ion gates, and ion diodes will provide avenues to devise technologies with enhanced performance inaccessible through macro/micro systems. This review aims to provide a consolidated body of knowledge to accelerate innovation and breakthrough in the above fields.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is inducing global warming, ocean acidification, polar ice melting, rise in sea level, droughts and hurricanes, thus threatening human health and the global economy. Therefore, there is a need to develop cost-effective technologies for CO2 capture. For instance, solution absorption is promising due to a large processing capacity, high flexibility and reliability, and rich experience in engineering applications. Nonetheless, actual commercial solutions, solvents and processes for CO2 capture suffer from slow reaction kinetics, low absorption capacity, high-energy consumption, susceptibility to corrosion, toxicity, low stability and high costs. Therefore, current research focuses on developing more economical, effective, green and sustainable technologies. Here we review 2015--2020 findings on CO2 capture using liquid absorption methods. Methods are based on various solutions, solvents and processes such as carbonate solution, ammonia solution, amine-based solution, ionic liquid, amino acid salt, phase changing absorbent, microcapsulated and membrane absorption, nanofluids and phenoxide salt solution. We discuss absorption performance, absorption mechanism, enhancement pathways and challenges. Amine- and NH3-based absorbents are widely used, yet they are limited by high regeneration energy, corrosiveness and degradation, reagent loss and secondary pollution caused by NH3 escape. Phase changing absorbents are getting more attention due to their lower cost and lower energy penalty. The incorporation of membrane and microencapsulation technologies to absorbing solvents could enhance CO2 absorption performance by reducing corrosion and increasing selectivity. Adding nanoparticles to solvents could improve CO2 absorption performance and reduce energy requirement. Besides, solvent blends and promoter-improved solvents performed better than single and non-promoted solvents because they combine the benefits of individual solvents and promoters.},

CALF-20's success story in the MOF commercialisation space provides new thinking about appropriate structural and adsorptive metrics important for CO2 capture. Here, we combine atomistic-level simulations with experiments to study adsorptive properties of CALF-20 and shed light on its flexible crystal structure. We compare measured and predicted CO2 and water adsorption isotherms and explain the role of water-framework interactions and hydrogen bonding networks in CALF-20's hydrophobic behaviour. Furthermore, regular and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations are performed with both density-functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained to DFT energies and forces. From these simulations, the effects of adsorption-induced flexibility in CALF-20 are uncovered. We envisage this work would encourage development of other MOF materials useful for CO2 capture applications in humid conditions.},

  abstract = {Examples of coupled irreversible processes like the thermoelectric phenomena, the transference phenomena in electrolytes and heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are considered. For certain cases of such interaction reciprocal relations have been deduced by earlier writers, e,g., Thomson's theory of thermoelectric phenomena and Helmholtz' theory for the e.m. f. of electrolytic cells with liquid junction. These earlier derivations may be classed as quasi-thermodynamic; in fact, Thomson himself pointed out that his argument was incomplete, and that: his relation ought to be established on an experimental basis. A general class of such relations will be derived by a new theoretical treatment from the principle of microscopic reversibility. ()\$1-2.) The analogy with a chemical monomolecular triangle reaction is discussed; in this case a a simple kinetic consideration assuming microscopic reversibility yields a reciprocal relation that is not necessary for fulfilling the requirements of thermodynamics (\$3). Reciprocal relations for heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are derived from the assumption of microscopic reversibility, applied to fluctuations. (\$4.) The reciprocal relations can be expressed in terms of a potential, the dissipation-function. Lord Rayleigh's "principle of the least dissipation of energy" is generalized to include the case of anisotropic heat conduction. A further generalization is announced. (\$5.\vphantom\{\} The conditions for stationary flow are formulated; the connection with earlier quasithermodynamic theories is discussed. (\$6.) The principle of dynamical reversibility does not apply when (external) magnetic fields or Coriolis forces are present, and the reciprocal relations break down. (\$7.) I. INTRODUCTION HEN two or more irreversible transport processes heat conduction, electrical conduction and diffusion take place simultaneously in a thermodynamic system the processes may interfere with each other. Thus an electric current in a circuit that consists of diAerent metallic conductors will in general cause evolution or absorption of heat at the junctions (Peltier e8'ect). Conversely, if the junctions are maintained at diferent temperatures an electromotive force will usually appear in the circuit, the thermoelectric force: the How of heat has a tendency to carry the electricity along. In such cases one may naturally suspect reciprocal relations by analogy to the reciprocal relations which connect forces and displacements in the equilibrium theory of mechanics and in thermodynamics. Relations of this type have been proposed and discussed by many writers. The earliest of them all is due to W. Thomson it deals with thermoelectric phenomena. We shall cite Thomson's reciprocal relation in a simple form as a symmetry condition for the relations which connect the forces with the velocities. The eIectric current we shall call J{\textasciitilde}, the heat How J2. The current is driven by the elec' \%. Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Proc. Roy. Soc.

No similar softening was observed under temperature increase, explaining the absence of temperature-induced amorphization in ZIF-8. We also demonstrate the large impact of the presence of adsorbate in the pores on the mechanical stability and compressibility of the framework, increasing its shear stability. This first molecular dynamics study of ZIF mechanical properties under variations of pressure, temperature, and pore filling opens the way to a more comprehensive understanding of their mechanical stability, structural transitions, and amorphization.},

The small wavenumber behavior of the partial structure factors indicates the presence of effective attractive interactions between molecules with similar local environments and effective repulsive interactions between molecules with different local environments. These effective interactions lead to significant concentration fluctuations under ambient conditions. The concentration fluctuations correlate with density fluctuations, and provide an explanation for the recently reported (Huang et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

  abstract = {Climate change calls for adaptation of negative emission technologies such as direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide (CO2) to lower the global warming impacts of greenhouse gases. Recently, elevated global interests to the DAC technologies prompted implementation of new tax credits and new policies worldwide that motivated the existing DAC companies and prompted the startup boom. There are presently 19 DAC plants operating worldwide, capturing more than 0.01 Mt CO2/year. DAC active plants capturing in average 10,000 tons of CO2 annually are still in their infancy and are expensive. DAC technologies still need to improve in three areas: 1) Contactor, 2) Sorbent, and 3) Regeneration to drive down the costs. Technology-based economic development in all three areas are required to achieve {$<\$$}100/ton of CO2 which makes DAC economically viable. Current DAC cost is about 2--6 times higher than the desired cost and depends highly on the source of energy used. In this review, we present the current status of commercial DAC technologies and elucidate the five pillars of technology including capture technologies, their energy demand, final costs, environmental impacts, and political support. We explain processing steps for liquid and solid carbon capture technologies and indicate their specific energy requirements. DAC capital and operational cost based on plant power energy sources, land and water needs of DAC are discussed in detail. At 0.01 Mt CO2/year capture capacity, DAC alone faces a challenge to meet the rates of carbon capture described in the goals of the Paris Agreement with 1.5--2 C of global warming. However, DAC may partially help to offset difficult to avoid annual emissions from concrete (\$8\%), transportation (\$24\%), iron-steel industry (\$11\%), and wildfires (\$0.8\%).},

For junctions formed by alkane chains, in which thermalization occurs only slowly, measurements reveal that thermal resistance is controlled by bonding with the substrates, whereas fluorination can introduce thermal resistance within the molecules themselves, although the mechanism remains unclear. Here we present results of quantum-mechanical calculations of elastic and inelastic scattering rates, the length over which thermalization occurs, and thermal conductance in alkane and perfluoroalkane junctions. The contribution to thermalization of quantum effects that give rise to many-body localization (MBL) in isolated molecules is examined. While MBL does not occur due to dephasing, thermalization is typically too slow to establish local temperature if the same molecule in isolation exhibits MBL. The results indicate limitations on the applicability of classical molecular simulations in modeling thermal transport in molecular junctions.},

  abstract = {Single-ion conducting polymers (SICs) are promising candidates for the next generation of safer polymer electrolytes due to their stability and high transference number. However, the conductivity in SICs is often limited by the mobility of the polymer backbone as the ion mobility is coupled to segmental relaxations. We present polymer blend electrolytes, consisting of a precise single Li-ion conducting polymer with a (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion pendant group and a low molar mass poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy is used to probe both the ion transport properties and segmental dynamics of these blends, and X-ray scattering is used to evaluate their morphology. PEO associates with the ionic groups of the SIC, forming a miscible blend with pathways that promote ion transport. At a high PEO content (an ethylene oxide to Li+ ratio of 10), ionic conductivities greater than 10-5 and 10-4 S cm-1 are achieved at 90 and 130 {$^\circ$}C, respectively. A comparison of conductivities and polymer relaxation times shows that the high PEO content blends exhibit superionic transport, in which there is some decoupling of the Li-ion motion from the backbone mobility. This superionic transport is uncommon in single Li-ion conductors above the glass transition temperature, thus this work presents a critical step toward establishing design rules for superionic transport in SICs.},

  abstract = {Filtering through to what's important                            Membranes are widely used for gas and liquid separations. Historical analysis of a range of gas pair separations indicated that there was an upper bound on the trade-off between membrane permeability, which limits flow rates, and the selectivity, which limits the quality of the separation process. Park               et al.               review the advances that have been made in attempts to break past this upper bound. Some inspiration has come from biological membranes. The authors also highlight cases where the challenges lie in areas other than improved separation performance.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaab0530                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Synthetic membranes are used for desalination, dialysis, sterile filtration, food processing, dehydration of air and other industrial, medical, and environmental applications due to low energy requirements, compact design, and mechanical simplicity. New applications are emerging from the water-energy nexus, shale gas extraction, and environmental needs such as carbon capture. All membranes exhibit a trade-off between permeability---i.e., how fast molecules pass through a membrane material---and selectivity---i.e., to what extent the desired molecules are separated from the rest. However, biological membranes such as aquaporins and ion channels are both highly permeable and highly selective. Separation based on size difference is common, but there are other ways to either block one component or enhance transport of another through a membrane. Based on increasing molecular understanding of both biological and synthetic membranes, key design criteria for new membranes have emerged: (i) properly sized free-volume elements (or pores), (ii) narrow free-volume element (or pore size) distribution, (iii) a thin active layer, and (iv) highly tuned interactions between permeants of interest and the membrane. Here, we discuss the permeability/selectivity trade-off, highlight similarities and differences between synthetic and biological membranes, describe challenges for existing membranes, and identify fruitful areas of future research.                                         ADVANCES               Many organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials have emerged as potential membranes. In addition to polymers, used for most membranes today, materials such as carbon molecular sieves, ceramics, zeolites, various nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, graphene oxide, and metal organic frameworks), and their mixtures with polymers have been explored. Simultaneously, global challenges such as climate change and rapid population growth stimulate the search for efficient water purification and energy-generation technologies, many of which are membrane-based. Additional driving forces include wastewater reuse from shale gas extraction and improvement of chemical and petrochemical separation processes by increasing the use of light hydrocarbons for chemicals manufacturing.                                         OUTLOOK               Opportunities for advancing membranes include (i) more mechanically, chemically, and thermally robust materials; (ii) judiciously higher permeability and selectivity for applications where such improvements matter; and (iii) more emphasis on fundamental structure/property/processing relations. There is a pressing need for membranes with improved selectivity, rather than membranes with improved permeability, especially for water purification. Modeling at all length scales is needed to develop a coherent molecular understanding of membrane properties, provide insight for future materials design, and clarify the fundamental basis for trade-off behavior. Basic molecular-level understanding of thermodynamic and diffusion properties of water and ions in charged membranes for desalination and energy applications such as fuel cells is largely incomplete. Fundamental understanding of membrane structure optimization to control transport of minor species (e.g., trace-organic contaminants in desalination membranes, neutral compounds in charged membranes, and heavy hydrocarbons in membranes for natural gas separation) is needed. Laboratory evaluation of membranes is often conducted with highly idealized mixtures, so separation performance in real applications with complex mixtures is poorly understood. Lack of systematic understanding of methodologies to scale promising membranes from the few square centimeters needed for laboratory studies to the thousands of square meters needed for large applications stymies membrane deployment. Nevertheless, opportunities for membranes in both existing and emerging applications, together with an expanding set of membrane materials, hold great promise for membranes to effectively address separations needs.                                                   From intrinsic permeability/selectivity trade-off to practical performance in membranes.                   Polymer membranes for liquid and gas separation applications obey a permeability/selectivity trade-off---highly permeable membranes have low selectivity and vice versa---largely due to broad distributions of free-volume elements (or pores in porous membranes) and nonspecific interactions between small solutes and polymers. We highlight materials approaches to overcome this trade-off, including the development of inorganic, isoporous, mixed matrix, and aquaporin membranes. Further, materials must be processed into thin, typically supported membranes, fashioned into high surface/volume ratio modules, and used in optimized processes. Thus, factors that govern the practical feasibility of membranes such as mechanical strength, module design, and operating conditions are also discussed.                                                                         ,              Increasing demands for energy-efficient separations in applications ranging from water purification to petroleum refining, chemicals production, and carbon capture have stimulated a vigorous search for novel, high-performance separation membranes. Synthetic membranes suffer a ubiquitous, pernicious trade-off: highly permeable membranes lack selectivity and vice versa. However, materials with both high permeability and high selectivity are beginning to emerge. For example, design features from biological membranes have been applied to break the permeability-selectivity trade-off. We review the basis for the permeability-selectivity trade-off, state-of-the-art approaches to membrane materials design to overcome the trade-off, and factors other than permeability and selectivity that govern membrane performance and, in turn, influence membrane design.},

  abstract = {A new method is presented to identify the truly interfacial molecules at fluid/fluid interfaces seen at molecular resolution, a situation that regularly occurs in computer simulations. In the new method, the surface is scanned by moving a probe sphere of a given radius along a large set of test lines that are perpendicular to the plane of the interface. The molecules that are hit by the probe spheres are regarded as interfacial ones, and the position of the test spheres when they are in contact with the interfacial molecules give an estimate of the surface. The dependence of the method on various parameters, in particular, on the size of the probe sphere is discussed in detail. Based on the list of molecules identified as truly interfacial ones, two measures of the molecular scale roughness of the surface are proposed. The bivariate distribution of the lateral and normal distances of two points of the interface provides a full description of the molecular scale morphology of the surface in a statistical sense. For practical purposes two parameters related to the dependence of the average normal distance of two surface points on their lateral distance can be used. These two parameters correspond to the frequency and amplitude of the surface roughness, respectively. The new method is applied for the analysis of the molecular level structure of the liquid--vapor interface of water. As an immediate result of the application of the new method it is shown that the orientational preferences of the interfacial water molecules depend only on the local curvature of the interface, and hence the molecules located at wells of concave curvature of the rippled surface prefer the same orientations as waters located at the surface of small apolar solutes. The vast majority of the truly interfacial molecules are found to form a strongly percolating two-dimensional hydrogen bonded network at the surface, whereas no percolation is observed within the second molecular layer beyond the surface.},

We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while considering also nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin 1/2 nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions, and is including a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical informations from CCMD trajectories are considered including a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, according to the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H-H vector D0 {\texttimes} {$\tau$}HH. The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contribution to the 1H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike to what was predicted earlier from classical MD simulations.},

Although the deuteron relaxation results are compatible with a water molecule dynamics model based on either a bimodal distribution of correlation times or anisotropic motion, a comparison of the present results with proton data suggests than an anisotropic motion model is more likely to provide a reasonable description of the water molecule motion. An analysis based on an anisotropic motion model that uses two correlation times to characterize the motion shows that most of the water molecules rotate about their twofold axis of symmetry at a rate that is only -100 times smaller than the rate of isotropic diffusion in the bulk liquid. The reorientation of the twofold axis of symmetry itself is characterized by a correlation time of 10-7 S.},

  abstract = {Comparatively small molecules such as peptides can show a high internal mobility with transitions between several conformational minima and sometimes coupling between rotational and internal degrees of freedom. In those cases the interpretation of NMR relaxation data is difficult and the use of standard methods for structure determination is questionable. On the other hand, in the case of those system sizes, the timescale of both rotational and internal motions is accessible by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using explicit solvent. Thus a comparison of distance averages ( r-6 -1/6 or r-3 1/3) over the MD trajectory with NOE (or ROE) derived distances is no longer necessary, the (back)calculation of the complete spectra becomes possible. In the present study we use two 200 ns trajectories of a heptapeptide of {$\beta$}-amino acids in methanol at two different temperatures to obtain theoretical ROESY spectra by calculating the exact spectral densities for the interproton vectors and the full relaxation matrix. Those data are then compared with the experimental ones. This analysis permits to test some of the assumptions and approximations that generally have to be made to interpret NMR spectra, and to make a more reliable prediction of the conformational equilibrium that leads to the experimental spectrum.},

  abstract = {Fluids confined in nanopores exhibit several unique structural and dynamical characteristics that affect a number of applications in industry as well as natural phenomena. Understanding and predicting the complex fluid behavior under nano-confinement is therefore of key importance, and both experimental and computational approaches have been employed toward this goal. It is now feasible to employ both simulations and theoretical methods, the results of which can be validated by cutting-edge experimental quantification. Nevertheless, predicting fluid transport through heterogeneous pore networks at a scale large enough to be relevant for practical applications remains elusive because one should account for a variety of fluid--rock interactions, a wide range of confined fluid states, as well as pore-edge effects and the existence of preferential pathways, which, together with many other phenomena, affect the results. The aim of this Review is to overview the significance of molecular phenomena on fluid transport in nanoporous media, the capability and shortcomings of both molecular and continuum fluid modeling approaches, and recent progress in multiscale modeling of fluid transport. In our interpretation, a multiscale approach couples a molecular picture for fluid interactions with solid surfaces at the single nanopore level with hierarchical transport analysis through realistic heterogeneous pore networks to balance physical accuracy with computational expense. When possible, comparison against experiments is provided as a guiding roadmap for selecting the appropriate computational methods. The appropriateness of an approach is certainly related to the final application of interest, as different sectors will require different levels of precision in the predictions.},

Due to an effective stronger attraction between water and the alumina surface, our simulations show that water is preferentially adsorbed in alumina nanopores from bulk solutions of varying composition. These results are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data reported by Rao and Sircar (Adsorpt. Sci. Technol. 1993, 10, 93). Analysis of the simulated trajectories allows us to predict that water diffuses through the narrow pores more easily than ethanol, in part because of its smaller size. Our results suggest that ethanol has an antiplasticization effect on water within the narrow pores considered here, whereas it has a plasticization effect on water in the bulk. Rao and Sircar suggested that alumina could be used in concentration swing and/or concentration-thermal swing adsorption processes to separate water from ethanol. In addition, our results suggest the possibility of using alumina for manufacturing permselective membranes to produce anhydrous ethanol from liquid water--ethanol solutions.},

The resulting correlation curves are then used to determine diffusion coefficients of fluorescent molecules or particles in solutions or membranes. Moreover, the technique can also be used for noninvasively measuring flow-velocity profiles in three dimensions. Because the distance between the focal regions is precisely known and not changed by most optical aberrations, this provides an accurate and immutable external length scale for determining diffusivities and velocities, making 2fFCS the method of choice for accurately measuring absolute values of these quantities at pico- to nanomolar concentration.},

However, there has been little published work with regards to their physical and mechanical properties. In this paper, detailed characterisation of PIM-1 was performed by considering its chemical, gas adsorption and mechanical properties. The polymer was cast into films, and characterised in terms of their hydrogen adsorption at -196~{$^\circ$}C up to much higher pressures (17~MPa) than previously reported (2~MPa), demonstrating the maximum excess adsorbed capacity of the material and its uptake behaviour in higher pressure regimes. The measured tensile strength of the polymer film was 31~MPa with a Young's modulus of 1.26~GPa, whereas the average storage modulus exceeded 960~MPa. The failure strain of the material was 4.4\%. It was found that the film is thermally stable at low temperatures, down to -150~{$^\circ$}C, and decomposition of the material occurs at 350~{$^\circ$}C. These results suggest that PIM-1 has sufficient elasticity to withstand the elastic deformations occurring within state-of-the-art high-pressure hydrogen storage tanks and sufficient thermal stability to be applied at the range of temperatures necessary for gas storage applications.},

Various tools have been exploited for revealing details concerning hydrogen bonding, as a function of decreasing temperature and ethanol concentration, like determining the H-bond acceptor and donor sites, calculating the cluster-size distributions and cluster topologies, and computing the Laplace spectra and fractal dimensions of the networks. It is found that 5-membered hydrogen-bonded cycles are dominant up to an ethanol mole fraction xeth = 0.7 at room temperature, above which the concentrated ring structures nearly disappear. Percolation has been given special attention, so that it could be shown that at low temperatures, close to the freezing point, even the mixture with 90\% ethanol (xeth = 0.9) possesses a three-dimensional (3D) percolating network. Moreover, the water subnetwork also percolates even at room temperature, with a percolation transition occurring around xeth = 0.5.},

When mixed in small concentrations with water or alkanes, it forms aggregate structures reminiscent of, respectively, the direct and inverse micellar aggregates found in emulsions, albeit at much smaller sizes. At higher concentrations, micro-heterogeneous mixing with segregated domains is found. We examine how different statistical methods, namely correlation function analysis, structure factor analysis and cluster distribution analysis, can describe efficiently these morphological changes in these mixtures. In particular, we explain how the neat alcohol pre-peak of the structure factor evolves into the domain pre-peak under mixing conditions, and how this evolution differs whether the co-solvent is water or alkane. This study clearly establishes the heuristic superiority of the correlation function/structure factor analysis to study the micro-heterogeneity, since cluster distribution analysis is insensitive to domain segregation. Correlation functions detect the domains, with a clear structure factor pre-peak signature, while the cluster techniques detect the cluster hierarchy within domains. The main conclusion is that, in micro-segregated mixtures, the domain structure is a more fundamental statistical entity than the underlying cluster structures. These findings could help better understand comparatively the radiation scattering experiments, which are sensitive to domains,               versus               the spectroscopy-NMR experiments, which are sensitive to clusters.},

By analogy with the membrane theory of thin shells, the deformation of the particulate lattice in the neighborhood of each atom is described in terms of a uniquely defined deformation gradient and companion local inner displacement. Expressions for the pointwise tensions developing in the plane of the lattice are developed, and a rational procedure for deriving discrete equilibrium equations is discussed. An alternative formulation involving the second-order deformation gradient that parallels the strain gradient theory of bulk media is proposed, and a tentative analogy with a the theory of micropolar elastic media is outlined.},

  abstract = {The behavior of water, methanol, and water-methanol mixtures confined in narrow slit graphite pores as a function of pore size was investigated by Monte Carlo, hybrid Monte Carlo, and Molecular Dynamics simulations. Interactions were described using TIP4P/2005 for water, OPLS/2016 for methanol, and cross interactions fitted to excess water/methanol properties over the whole range of concentrations, which provide a rather accurate description of water-methanol mixtures. As expected for hydrophobic pores, whereas pure methanol is adsorbed already from the gas phase, pure water only enters the pore at pressures well beyond bulk saturation for all pore sizes considered. When adsorbed from a mixture, however, water adsorbs at much lower pressures due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with previously adsorbed methanol molecules. For all studied compositions and pore sizes, methanol adsorbs preferentially over water at liquid-vapor equilibrium conditions. In pure components, both water and methanol are microscopically structured in layers, the number of layers increasing with pore size. This is also the case in adsorbed mixtures, in which methanol has a higher affinity for the walls. This becomes more evident as the pore widens. Diffusion of pure water is higher than that of pure methanol for all pore sizes due to the larger size of the methyl group. In mixtures, both components present similar diffusivities at all pore sizes, which is explained in terms of the coupling of molecular movements due to strong hydrogen bonding between methanol and water molecules. This is particularly evident in very narrow pores, in which pure methanol diffusion is completely impeded on the time scale of our simulations, but the presence of a small amount of water molecules facilitates alcohol diffusion following a single-file mechanism. Additionally, our results indicate that pure water diffusivities display a non-monotonous dependence of pore size, due to effects of confinement (proximity to a fluid-solid-fluid transition induced by confinement as reported in previous work) and the dynamic anomalies of water.},

It is shown that the WTPI method fails to accurately compute the chemical potentials of water and methanol in the liquid phase at low temperatures, while accurate chemical potentials in the liquid phase are computed using CFCGE MC method. For the CFCGE MC method, the statistical uncertainty for computed chemical potentials of water and methanol in the liquid phase are considerably smaller compared to the WTPI method. For the water models considered in this study (SPC, TIP3P-EW, TIP4P-EW, TIP5P-EW), computed excess chemical potentials based on three-site models are in better agreement with the chemical potentials computed from an empirical equation of state from the NIST database. For water, orientational biasing is applied during test particle insertion to check whether certain orientations of test particle are energetically unfavourable. A two-dimensional Overlapping Distribution Method (ODM) in the NVT ensemble is derived for this purpose. It is shown that failure of the WTPI method for systems with a strong hydrogen bonding network does not depend on orientation of the test molecule in that system. For all systems in this study, the WTPI method breaks down when the void fraction of the system drops below approximately 0.50.},

However, it is still unclear how the trichome of T. landbeckii and other Tillandsia species is able to absorb fine water droplets during intermittent fog events while also preventing evaporation when the plant is exposed to the desert's hyperarid conditions. Here, we explain how a 5800-fold asymmetry in water conductance arises from a clever juxtaposition of a thick hygroscopic wall and a semipermeable membrane. While absorption is achieved by osmosis of liquid water, evaporation under dry external conditions shifts the liquid-gas interface forcing water to diffuse through the thick trichome wall in the vapor phase. We confirm this mechanism by fabricating artificial composite membranes mimicking the trichome structure. The reliance on intrinsic material properties instead of moving parts makes the trichome a promising basis for the development of microfluidics valves.},

J. 2011, 40, 843-856] and involves a recalibration of the nonbonded interaction parameters for the charged amino acid side chains, based on ionic side chain analogs. After a thorough analysis of the available experimental data, conventional hydration free energies for the ammonium; mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramethyl-ammonium; formate; acetate; propanoate; imidazolium; and guanidinium ions are combined with a standard absolute intrinsic proton hydration free energy {$\Delta$}Gh{$\ominus$}yd[Hg+] = -1100 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1 to yield absolute intrinsic single-ion hydration free energies serving as experimental target data. The raw hydration free energies calculated from atomistic simulations are affected by electrostatic and finite-size artifacts, and corrections are applied to reach methodological independence prior to comparison with these experimental values. Except for monomethyl-ammonium, ions with parameters derived directly from the 54A7 force field considerably underestimate (ammonium, formate, acetate, propanoate, guanidinium) or overestimate (di-, tri-, and tetramethyl-ammonium; imidazolium) the magnitude of the intrinsic hydration free energy, the largest deviation affecting the acetate ion (40.0 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1). After reparameterization into 54A8, the mean and maximal absolute deviations between simulated and experimental data over the set of 10 ions are reduced from 23.1 and 40.0 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1, respectively, to 1.8 and 6.3 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1, respectively. Although the 54A7 and 54A8 parameter sets differ significantly in terms of the hydration free energies of the ions considered, other properties such as ion-water radial distribution functions and ion-ion potentials of mean force appear to be only moderately sensitive to this change. These properties are similar for the two sets and, in the case of the ion-water radial distribution functions, in good agreement with available experimental data.},

The algorithm presented here achieves two major goals; a more accurate estimation of D as well as extracting information about the short time behavior. The algorithm fits the MSD to a continuous piece-wise function and predicts all the coefficients in the model including the breakpoints. The novelty of this approach lies in its ability to find the breakpoints which separate different modes of motion. We tested our algorithm using numerical experiments, and our fits described the data remarkably well. In addition, we applied our algorithm to extract D for water based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The results of our fits are in good agreement with the experimentally reported values.},

The results show competitive sorption effects in all gas mixtures analyzed, affecting each species in proportion to the total sorbed concentration of the other components. It was found that the presence of C2H6 in the mixture reduces the sorption of both CH4 and CO2 to a similar extent, so that the CO2/CH4 solubility-selectivity is not markedly affected. The experimental data were used to validate predictions of the Non-Equilibrium Lattice Fluid (NELF) model of binary and ternary sorption isotherms. The NELF model is generally in close agreement, both in the prediction of pressure and mixture composition effects, proving to be a reliable tool to assess mixed-gas sorption, even in complex scenarios.},

In this review, inspired by his rigorous and original approach to representing membrane fundamentals, we provide an overview of the most significant and up-to-date modeling tools available to estimate the main properties governing polymeric membranes in fluid separation, namely solubility and diffusivity. The paper is not meant to be comprehensive, but it focuses on those contributions that are most relevant or that show the potential to be relevant in the future. We do not restrict our view to the field of macroscopic modelling, which was the main playground of professor Sarti, but also devote our attention to Molecular and Multiscale Hierarchical Modeling.

Analysis of the OSG systems indicated that the structural features (bond distances and angles) as well as the Qn distribution of the nanoporous silica backbone structure are consistent with the features of dense silica and that the geometry of the added methyl groups is experimentally accurate, even after ReaxFF relaxation.

It has been recognized in the past decade that the separation factor for gas pairs varies inversely with the permeability of the more permeable gas of the specific pair. An analysis of the literature data for binary gas mixtures from the list of He, H2, O2, N2, CH4, and CO2 reveals an upper bound relationship for these mixtures. The upper bound can be represented by a log-log plot of {$\alpha$}ij (separation factor = Pi/Pj) versus Pi (where Pi = permeability of the more permeable gas). Above the linear upper bound on the log-log plot, virtually no values exist. The slope of this line (n) from the relationship Pi=k{$\alpha$}nij can be related to the difference between the gas molecular diameters {$\Delta$}dji (djdi) where the gas molecular diameter chosen is the Lennard-Jones kinetic diameter. This relationship yields linearity for a plot of -1/n versus {$\Delta$}dji, and the line passes through (0,0) for the x--y plot thus providing further verification of this analysis. These results indicate that the diffusion coefficient governs the separating capabilities of polymers for these gas pairs. As the polymer molecular spacing becomes tighter the permeability decreases due to decreasing diffusion coefficients, but the separation characteristics are enhanced.},

Below this line on a plot of log{$\alpha$}ij versus logPi, virtually all the experimental data points exist. In spite of the intense investigation resulting in a much larger dataset than the original correlation, the upper bound position has had only minor shifts in position for many gas pairs. Where more significant shifts are observed, they are almost exclusively due to data now in the literature on a series of perfluorinated polymers and involve many of the gas pairs comprising He. The shift observed is primarily due to a change in the front factor, k, whereas the slope of the resultant upper bound relationship remains similar to the prior data correlations. This indicates a different solubility selectivity relationship for perfluorinated polymers compared to hydrocarbon/aromatic polymers as has been noted in the literature. Two additional upper bound relationships are included in this analysis; CO2/N2 and N2/CH4. In addition to the perfluorinated polymers resulting in significant upper bound shifts, minor shifts were observed primarily due to polymers exhibiting rigid, glassy structures including ladder-type polymers. The upper bound correlation can be used to qualitatively determine where the permeability process changes from solution-diffusion to Knudsen diffusion.},

  abstract = {Nanofluidics, the field interested in flows at the smallest scales, has grown at a fast pace, reaching an ever finer control of fluidic and ionic transport at the molecular level. Until now, artificial pores are far from reaching the wealth of functionalities of biological channels that regulate sensory detection, biological transport, and neurostransmission---all while operating at energies comparable to thermal noise. Here, we argue that artificial ionic machines can be designed by harnessing the entire wealth of phenomena available at the nanoscales and exploiting techniques developed in various fields of physics. As they are generally based on solid-state nanopores, rather than soft membranes and proteins, they should, in particular, aim at taking advantage of their specific properties, such as their electronic structure or their ability to interact with light. These observations call for the design of new ways of probing nanofluidic systems. Nanofluidics is now at the crossroads, there are new avenues to build complex ionic machines, and this may allow to develop new functionalities inspired by nature.},

  abstract = {Diffusion of a particle through an energy and diffusivity landscape is a very general phenomenon in numerous systems of soft and condensed matter. On the one hand, theoretical frameworks such as Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations present valuable accounts to understand these motions in great detail, and numerous studies have exploited these approaches. On the other hand, analytical solutions for correlation functions, as, e.g., desired by experimentalists for data fitting, are only available for special cases. We explore the possibility to use different theoretical methods in the specific picture of time-dependent switching between diffusive states to derive analytical functions that allow to link experimental and simulation results to theoretical calculations. In particular, we present a closed formula for diffusion switching between two states, as well as a general recipe of how to generalize the formula to multiple states.},

  abstract = {Massive foam formation in aquatic environments is a seasonal event that has a significant impact on the stability of marine ecosystems. Liquid foams are known to filter passive solid particles, with large particles remaining trapped by confinement in the network of liquid channels and small particles being freely advected by the gravity-driven flow. By contrast, the potential role of a similar retention effect on biologically active particles such as phytoplankton cells is still relatively unknown. To assess if phytoplankton cells are passively advected through a foam, the model unicellular motile alga               Chlamydomonas reinhardtii               (CR) was incorporated in a bio-compatible foam, and the number of cells escaping the foam at the bottom was measured in time. Comparing the escape dynamics of living and dead CR cells, we found that dead cells are totally advected by the liquid flow towards the bottom of the foam, as expected since the diameter of CR remains smaller than the typical foam channel diameter. By contrast, living motile CR cells escape the foam at a significantly lower rate: after 2 hours, up to 60\% of the injected cells may remain blocked in the foam, while 95\% of the initial liquid volume in the foam has been drained out of the foam. Microscopic observation of the swimming CR cells in a chamber mimicking the cross-section of foam internal channels revealed that swimming CR cells accumulate near channels corners. A theoretical analysis based on the probability density measurements in the micro chambers has shown that this trapping at the microscopic scale contributes to explain the macroscopic retention of the microswimmers in the foam. At the crossroads of distinct fields including marine ecology of planktonic organisms, fluid dynamics of active particles in a confined environment and the physics of foam, this work represents a significant step in the fundamental understanding of the ecological consequences of aquatic foams in water bodies.},

Water cages enveloping methane are stable, although they present small probability to occur.           ,                             Characterization of hydrogen bonds in CH               4               --(H               2               O)               12               clusters was carried out by using several quantum chemistry tools. An initial stochastic search provided around 2\,500\,000 candidate structures, then, using a convex-hull polygon criterion followed by gradient based optimization under the Kohn--Sham scheme, a total of 54 well defined local minima were located in the Potential Energy Surface. These structures were further analyzed through second-order many-body perturbation theory with an extended basis set at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. Our analysis of Gibbs energies at several temperatures clearly suggests a structural preference toward compact water clusters interacting with the external methane molecule, instead of the more commonly known clathrate-like structures. This study shows that CH               4               --(H               2               O)               12               clusters may be detected at temperatures up to 179 K, this finding provides strong support to a recently postulated hypothesis that suggests that methane--water clusters could be present in Mars at these conditions. Interestingly, we found that water to water hydrogen bonding is strengthened in the mixed clusters when compared to the isolated water dimer, which in turn leads to a weakening of the methane to water hydrogen bonding when compared to the CH               4               --(H               2               O) dimer.

When local temperatures are measured, e.g., from a set of atoms in a subvolume or from velocities in one Cartesian direction, the result can appear to unphysically violate equipartition of the kinetic energy if the local DoF are not correctly calculated. Here, we determine how to correctly calculate local temperatures from arbitrary Cartesian component kinetic energies, accounting for general geometric constraints, by self-consistently evaluating the DoF of atoms subjected to those constraints. The method is validated on a variety of test systems, including systems subject to a temperature gradient and those confined between walls. It is also shown to provide a sensitive test for the breakdown of kinetic energy equipartition caused by the approximate nature of numerical integration or insufficient equilibration times. As a practical demonstration, we show that kinetic energy equipartition between C and H atoms connected by rigid bonds can be violated even at the commonly used time step of 2 fs and that this equipartition violation appears to usefully indicate configurational overheating.},

  abstract = {Traditional theories of the NMR autocorrelation function for intramolecular dipole pairs assume single-exponential decay, yet the calculated autocorrelation of realistic systems display a rich, multi-exponential behavior resulting in anomalous NMR relaxation dispersion (i.e., frequency dependence). We develop an approach to model and interpret the multi-exponential autocorrelation using simple, physical models within a rigorous statistical mechanical development that encompasses both rotational and translational diffusion in the same framework. We recast the problem of evaluating the autocorrelation in terms of averaging over a diffusion propagator whose evolution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation. The time-independent part admits an eigenfunction expansion, allowing us to write the propagator as a sum over modes. Each mode has a spatial part that depends on the specified eigenfunction, and a temporal part that depends on the corresponding eigenvalue (i.e., correlation time) with a simple, exponential decay. The spatial part is a probability distribution of the dipole-pair, analogous to the stationary states of a quantum harmonic oscillator. Drawing inspiration from the idea of inherent structures in liquids, we interpret each of the spatial contributions as a specific molecular mode. These modes can be used to model and predict NMR dipole-dipole relaxation dispersion of fluids by incorporating phenomena on the molecular level. We validate our statistical mechanical description of the distribution in molecular modes with molecular dynamics simulations interpreted without any relaxation models or adjustable parameters: the most important poles in the Pad\{{\textbackslash}'e\}-Laplace transform of the simulated autocorrelation agree with the eigenvalues predicted by the theory.},

Fluorescent rhodamine molecules were tracked on silica surfaces as a function of ambient relative humidity, which controlled the thickness of condensed water nanofilms. At low humidity, the molecules exhibited confined diffusion in the vicinity of isolated adsorption sites characterized by a broad distribution of binding stiffness constants; subsequent chemical or physical surface passivation selectively eliminated stiffer binding sites. At increased humidity, molecularly thin water films condensed, permitting near-surface transport of rhodamine molecules. Motion was subdiffusive, with an anomalous exponent increasing with the nanofilm thickness. Molecular trajectories were temporally anticorrelated, ergodic, but also featured transient binding and intermittent diffusion. Statistical modeling demonstrated that this complex motion in water nanofilms had the characteristics of fractional Brownian motion combined with a continuous-time random walk. This was consistent with diffusion within viscoelastic nanofilms, suggesting persistent molecular structuring in the vicinity of the silica surface.},

The analysis of the complex permittivity spectra measured in the frequency range 0.1Vm/GHzV89 reveals that in the alcohol-rich region of {\textasciitilde}0.3VXAV1.0, where XA is the mole fraction of alcohol, a three-step relaxation model is most appropriate for the description of the spectra whereas at low XA the intermediate process becomes too small to be resolved. The dominating low-frequency Cole--Cole (CC) dispersion ( j=1) is assigned to the cooperative dynamics of the H-bond system where the motions of alcohol and water molecules cannot be distinguished. Its time scale is largely governed by the number density of H-bond acceptor and donor sites but steric effects also contribute. Two additional Debye (D) terms ( j=2 and j=3) with relaxation times of s2{\textasciitilde}10--20 ps and s3{\textasciitilde}1--2 ps are required to reproduce the high-frequency part of the spectrum. These small-amplitude dispersion steps can be assigned to the motion of singly H-bonded alcohol monomers at the ends of the chain structure ( j=2) and to the flipping motion of free OH ( j=3). The increase of the amplitude De2 and the simultaneous decrease of the (effective) dipole--dipole correlation factor with decreasing XA in {\textasciitilde}0.5VXAV1.0 suggests insertion of water molecules into the zigzag structure of H-bonded alcohol chains inducing a reduction of the average chain length and an increase of the number of end-standing alcohol molecules that can contribute to the s2-mode.},

SLGS models represented by circular and rectangular plates are subjected to linear and nonlinear geometric point loading, similar to what is induced by an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. The graphene models are developed using both a lattice and a continuum finite element discretization of the partial differential equations describing the mechanics of the graphene. The minimization of the potential energy allows us to identify the thickness, elastic parameters and force/displacement histories of the plates, in good agreement with other molecular dynamic (MD) and experimental results. We note a substantial equivalence of the linear elastic mechanical properties exhibited by circular and rectangular sheets, while some differences in the nonlinear geometric elastic regime for the two geometrical configurations are observed. Enhanced flexibility of SLGSs is observed by comparing the nondimensional force versus displacement relations derived in this work and the analogous ones related to equivalent plates with conventional isotropic materials.},

The water sorption isotherms for both materials followed behavior indicative of multilayer adsorption within the microvoids, with PIM-1 registering a significant water uptake at very high water activities. Analysis of the sorption isotherms using a modified dual sorption model which accounts for such multilayer effects gave Langmuir affinity constants more consistent with lighter gases than the use of the standard dual mode approach. The water permeability through PTMSP and PIM-1 was comparable over the water activities studied, and could be successfully modeled through a dual mode sorption model with a concentration dependent diffusivity. The water permeability through both membranes as a function of temperature was also measured, and found to be at a minimum at 80 {$^\circ$}C for PTMSP and 70 {$^\circ$}C for PIM-1. This temperature dependence is a function of reducing water solubility in both membranes with increasing temperature countered by increasing water diffusivity. The CO2 - N2 mixed gas permeabilities through PTMSP and PIM-1 were also measured and modeled through dual mode sorption theory. Introducing water vapour further reduced both the CO2 and N2 permeabilities. The plasticization potential of water in PTMSP was determined and indicated water swelled the membrane increasing CO2 and N2 diffusivity, while for PIM-1 a negative potential implied that water filling of the microvoids hampered CO2 and N2 diffusion through the membrane. {\copyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

From solvent-explicit molecular dynamics simulations, we extract single-ion surface interaction potentials for halide and alkali ions at hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. These are used within Poisson-Boltzmann theory to calculate ion density and electrostatic potential distributions at mixed polar/unpolar surfaces for varying surface charge. The resulting interfacial tension increments agree quantitatively with experimental data and capture the Hofmeister series, especially the anomaly of lithium, which is difficult to obtain using continuum theory. Phase diagrams that feature different Hofmeister series as a function of surface charge, salt concentration, and surface polarity are constructed from the long-range force between two surfaces interacting across electrolyte solutions. Large anions such as iodide have a high hydrophobic surface affinity and increase the effective charge magnitude on negatively charged unpolar surfaces. Large cations such as cesium also have a large hydrophobic surface affinity and thereby compensate an external negative charge surface charge most efficiently, which explains the well-known asymmetry between cations and anions. On the hydrophilic surface, the size-dependence of the ion surface affinity is reversed, explaining the Hofmeister series reversal when comparing hydrophobic with hydrophilic surfaces.},

As local structural order parameters we consider the tetrahedrality and the number of hydrogen bonds and calculate all pure and mixed spatial two-point correlation functions. Except for the density-density correlation function, there are only weak features present in all other correlation functions, showing that the tendency to form structural clusters is much weaker than the well-known tendency of water to form density clusters (i.e., spatially correlated regions where the density deviates from the mean). In particular, there are only small spatial correlations between local density and structural fluctuations, suggesting that features in density-density correlations (such as measured by the structure factor) are not straightforwardly related to spatial correlations of structure in liquid water.},

Deprotonated surface silanol sites are also described within the model based on DDEC charges.

Droplets are driven by an external body force (gravity) and we investigate the velocity profile and dissipation mechanisms in the steady state. The cylindrical geometry allows us to consider a large range of droplet sizes. The velocity of small droplets with a large contact angle is dominated by the friction at the substrate and the velocity of the center of mass scales like the square root of the droplet size. For large droplets or small contact angles, however, viscous dissipation of the flow inside the volume of the droplet dictates the center of mass velocity that scales linearly with the size. We derive a simple analytical description predicting the dependence of the center of mass velocity on droplet size and the slip length at the substrate. In the limit of vanishing droplet velocity we quantitatively compare our simulation results to the predictions and good agreement without adjustable parameters is found.},

Moreover, we obtain a lower bound for the two-dimensional diffusion coefficient of ethanol in water of D {$\geq$} 2 {\texttimes} 10-14 m2 s-1.

Employing scanning force microscopy of the graphene layers conforming to the molecular films we quantify the patterns using the ethanol-water cross correlation and the autocorrelation of domain wall directions. They reveal that lateral pattern dimensions grow and the domain walls stiffen upon increasing the thickness of the graphene multilayers. We attribute the control of the patterns through the graphene layers to the competition between the mechanical deformation energy of the graphene sheets and the electrostatic repulsion of dipoles normal to the interface. The latter results from charge transfer between graphene and the molecules confined between mica and graphene.},

Given the wide distribution of pore sizes, linker functionalization, and crystal sizes, molecular diffusion within MOFs can be highly dependent on the MOF-guest system. In this review, we discuss the major factors that govern the mass transport of molecules through MOFs at both the intracrystalline and intercrystalline scale; provide an overview of the experimental and computational methods used to measure guest diffusivity within MOFs; and highlight the relevance of mass transfer in the applications of MOFs in electrochemical systems, separations, and heterogeneous catalysis.},

  abstract = {This review discusses the cryogenic capture system from the perspective of constructing new cryogenic capture system structures, exploring the optimal system parameters, and analyzing the challenges faced by different cryogenic capture systems. The gas that needs to remove CO2 undergoes desulfurization, denitrification and dust removal treatment, which can effectively reduce impurities and remove, and ensure the progress of the subsequent carbon capture process. Among the cryogenic technologies of carbon capture, cryogenic distillation is restricted by the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the gas and cost, and it cannot be widely popularized. Cryogenic condensation offers a wide range of industrial applications because it may immediately liquefy CO2 for oil displacement. Currently, the most concerned cryogenic sublimation can capture low-concentration CO2 at a rate of 99.9\% at 13.5~vol\%, and energy consumption and annual investment costs can also be effectively reduced. In general, cryogenic CO2 capture technology provides remarkable cost and efficiency benefits compared with other carbon capture technologies. By 2030, China's CO2 capture cost will be 13--57\$/t, and it will be 3--19\$/t in 2060. Combining fixed costs and operating costs, the total abatement cost is 65\$/t CO2, which is similar to the cost of 54\$/ton CO2 in Japan and 60--193\$/t CO2 in Australia. By 2060, the carbon emission reduction ratio of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) will account for about 10\% of the total emission reduction, so the research on CCUS is very urgent. It must break through the extreme utilization of cold energy and energy consumption barriers as well as increase the efficiency of the system.},

  abstract = {We present a novel computational methodology for determining fluid-phase equilibria in binary mixtures. The method is based on a combination of highly efficient transition-matrix Monte Carlo and histogram reweighting. In particular, a directed grand-canonical transition-matrix Monte Carlo scheme is used to calculate the particle-number probability distribution, after which histogram reweighting is used as a postprocessing procedure to determine the conditions of phase equilibria. To validate the methodology, we have applied it to a number of model binary Lennard-Jones systems known to exhibit nontrivial fluid-phase behavior. Although we have focused on monatomic fluids in this work, the method presented here is general and can be easily extended to more complex molecular fluids. Finally, an important feature of this method is the capability to predict the entire fluid-phase diagram of a binary mixture at fixed temperature in a single simulation.},

  abstract = {Nanoporous carbons, as promising adsorbents for CO2 capture and separation from flue gas, span the major challenge of optimizing the physicochemical property to meet the need of CO2 capture and separation. Herein, we rationally engineered sustainable nanoporous carbons with tailorable porosity and rich surface chemistry using an activating agent of small-molecule organic acids. The porosity could be easily tailored by varying the activation temperature and activator dosage. The surface chemistry and morphology could be tuned by changing the dopant concentration. In detail, porosity played a determinant role in CO2 adsorption capacity, especially ultramicroporosity. Narrow micropores brought major contributions to CO2 uptake at low pressure, while mesopores played a great role at high adsorption pressure. Surface chemistry played a critical role in CO2 capture, especially adsorption selectivity and the isosteric heat of adsorption when the ultramicroporosity was optimal. We revealed that the C--OH group (one type of oxygen-containing species) made a relatively high contribution for improving CO2 capture by hydrogen bonding. For nitrogen-containing groups, the pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and amine groups provoked more improvements in CO2 capture by offering more basic CO2-philic sites, while the oxidized-N group made a weak influence. Sheet-like structures exhibited more accessible affine sites for fast CO2 capture and separation. We proposed a valuable reference for rationally engineering nanoporous carbons with the optimal texture to meet the different requirements of CO2 capture. More importantly, the conversion of biowaste into high-added-value adsorbents for effective CO2 capture and separation opened up an elegant route of killing two birds with one stone.},

  abstract = {Molecular simulations of water adsorption in porous materials often converge slowly due to sampling bottlenecks that follow from hydrogen bonding and, in many cases, the formation of water clusters. These effects may be exacerbated in metal- organic framework (MOF) adsorbents, due to the presence of pore spaces (cages) that promote the formation of discrete-size clusters and hydrophobic effects (if present), among other reasons. In Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, these sampling challenges are typically manifested by low MC acceptance ratios, a tendency for the simulation to become stuck in a particular loading state (i.e., macrostates), and the persistence of specific clusters for long periods of the simulation. We present simulation strategies to address these sampling challenges, by applying flat-histogram MC (FHMC) methods and specialized MC move types to simulations of water adsorption. FHMC, in both Transition-matrix and Wang-Landau forms, drives the simulation to sample relevant macrostates by incorporating weights that are self-consistently adjusted throughout the simulation and generate the macrostate probability distribution (MPD). Specialized MC moves, based on aggregation-volume bias and configurational bias methods, separately address low acceptance ratios for basic MC trial moves and specifically target water molecules in clusters; in turn, the specialized MC moves improve the efficiency of generating new configurations which is ultimately reflected in improved statistics collected by FHMC. The combined strategies are applied to study the adsorption of water in CuBTC and ZIF-8 at 300 K, through examination of the MPD and the adsorption isotherm generated by histogram reweighting. A key result is the appearance of nontrivial oscillations in the MPD, which we show to be associated with water clusters in the adsorption system. Additionally, we show that the probabilities of certain clusters become similar in value near the boundaries of the isotherm hysteresis loop, indicating a strong connection between cluster formation/ destruction and the thermodynamic limits of stability. For a hydrophobic MOF, the FHMC results show that the phase transition from low density to high density is suppressed to water pressure far above the bulk-fluid saturation pressure; this is consistent with results presented elsewhere. We also compare our FHMC simulation isotherm to one measured by a different technique but with ostensibly the same molecular interactions and comment on observed differences and the need for follow-up work. The simulation strategies presented here can be applied to the simulation of water in other MOFs using heuristic guidelines laid out in our text, which should facilitate the more consistent and efficient simulation of water adsorption in porous materials in future applications.},

In this work, we perform numerical simulations of athermal semiflexible sheets with hydrodynamic interactions in shear flow. For sheets initially oriented near the flow-vorticity plane, we find buckling instabilities of different mode numbers that vary with bending stiffness and can be understood with a quasi-static model of elasticity. For different initial orientations, chaotic tumbling trajectories are observed. Notably, we find that sheets fold or crumple before tumbling but do not stretch again upon applying greater shear.},

Likewise, the translational diffusion DT coefficients calculated using simulation configurations agree with measured diffusion data at ambient conditions. The agreement between the predicted and experimentally measured NMR relaxation times and diffusion coefficient also validate the forcefields used in the simulation. The molecular simulations naturally separate intramolecular from intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions helping bring new insight into the two NMR relaxation mechanisms as a function of molecular chain-length (i.e. carbon number). Comparison of the MD simulation results of the two relaxation mechanisms with traditional hard-sphere models used in interpreting NMR data reveals important limitations in the latter. With increasing chain length, there is substantial deviation in the molecular size inferred on the basis of the radius of gyration from simulation and the fitted hard-sphere radii required to rationalize the relaxation times. This deviation is characteristic of the local nature of the NMR measurement, one that is well-captured by molecular simulations.},

The simulated diffusion-coefficients agree well with measurements, without any adjustable parameters in the interpretation of the simulations. A minimization technique is developed to compute the angular velocity for non-rigid spherical molecules, which is used to simulate the autocorrelation function for spin-rotation interactions. With increasing diffusivity, the autocorrelation function shows increasing deviations from the single-exponential decay predicted by the Langevin theory for rigid spheres, and the deviations are quantified using inverse Laplace transforms. The 1H spin-rotation relaxation rate derived from the autocorrelation function using the ``kinetic model'' agrees well with measurements in the supercritical/gas phase, while the relaxation rate derived using the ``diffusion model'' agrees well with measurements in the liquid phase. 1H spin-rotation relaxation is shown to dominate over the MD-simulated 1H-1H dipole-dipole relaxation at high diffusivity, while the opposite is found at low diffusivity. At high diffusivity, the simulated spin-rotation correlation time agrees with the kinetic collision time for gases, which is used to derive a new expression for 1H spin-rotation relaxation, without any adjustable parameters.},

A model of the relaxation processes in the membranes has been proposed. The model includes two relaxation contributions. One of them corresponds to the concept of restricted, two-dimensional translation diffusion with a residence lifetime, while the second one has the form characteristic of polymers (mathematically similar to the limiting behavior of two-dimensional translation diffusion with a very long residence lifetime). The extensive dataset has been consistently interpreted in terms of the model, revealing two dynamical processes on the time scales of 10-7~s (for the second relaxation contribution) and 10-9~s (for the first one).

Our computational model solves the flow and transport equations with variable solute-dependent properties. We utilize a high resolution computational mesh to resolve all relevant length scales associated with spacer-induced mixing and thin concentration boundary layers. An important contribution of this work is the development of a modified mass-transfer correlation that accounts for the development of the concentration boundary layer along the channel. A set of 2D axisymmetric simulations were performed for a spiral wound module layer with varying cross-flow conditions and spacer diameters which indicate a significant entrance length effect for concentration profile development at lower flow rates while mixing effects dominate at higher flow rates. The mass-transfer correlations at higher flow rates compare well with published correlations while a surrogate model for Sherwood number was obtained that depends on an additional similarity variable that accounted for entrance length effects at lower flow rates. Finally, a large-scale membrane-spacer design relevant to high-pressure reverse osmosis is studied with a non-uniform arrangement of spacers, which indicate a substantial saving in pressure drop ({$\sim$} 40\%) compared to traditional uniformly spaced pattern with minor variations ({$\sim$} 2\%) in concentration polarization, product water quality ({$\sim$} 1\%) and water recovery ({$\sim$} 7\%) compared to a uniform spacer pattern.},

The oxygen-hydrogen contribution to the measured x-ray scattering pattern was subtracted using literature data to yield an experimental determination, with error bars, of the oxygen-oxygen pair-distribution function, gOO(r), which essentially describes the distribution of molecular centers. The extended Q-range and low statistical noise of these measurements has significantly reduced truncation effects and related errors in the gOO(r) functions obtained. From these measurements and error analysis, the position and height of the nearest neighbor maximum in gOO(r) were found to be 2.80(1) {\AA} and 2.57(5) respectively. Numerical data for the coherent differential x-ray scattering cross-section IX(Q), the oxygen-oxygen structure factor SOO(Q), and the derived gOO(r) are provided as benchmarks for calibrating force-fields for water.},

The present study discusses the extraction of radial distribution functions from the x-ray scattering of molecular fluids. It is proposed that the atomic scattering factors used to model water be modified to include the changes in the intramolecular electron distribution caused by chemical bonding effects. Based on this analysis we present a gOO(r) for water consistent with our recent experimental data gathered at the ALS, which differs in some aspects from the gOO(r) reported by other x-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our gOO(r) exhibits a taller and sharper first peak, and systematic shifts in all peak positions to smaller r. Based on experimental uncertainties, we discuss what features of gOO(r) should be reproduced by classical simulations of nonpolarizable and polarizable water models, as well as ab initio simulations of water, at ambient conditions. We directly compare many water models and simulations to the present data, and discuss possible improvements in both classical and ab initio simulation approaches in the future.},

The isotope effect of a solvent significantly influences the behavior of a single molecule in a solution, especially when there are interactions between the solvent and the solute. The influence of the isotope effect becomes more significant in D               2               O/H               2               O since the hydrogen bond in H               2               O is slightly weaker than its counterpart (deuterium bond) in D               2               O. Herein, we characterize the isotope effect in a mixture of normal and heavy water on the solvation of a HOD molecule. We show that the HOD molecule affects the proximal solvent molecules, and these disturbances are much more significant in heavy water than in normal water. Moreover, in D               2               O, we observe the formation of low-density structures indicative of an ordering of the solvent around the HOD molecule.

  abstract = {Identifying materials that can efficiently separate CO2 from natural gas (CO2/CH4), power-plant flue gas (CO2/N2), and petroleum refinery gas streams (CO2/H2) is crucial. We used molecular simulations to examine the adsorption-based separation performances of MOFs in the separations of CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/H2 mixtures under different operating conditions. We first compared the results of our molecular simulations with the experimentally available data for the CO2 adsorption and separation performances of various MOFs. Motivated by the good agreement between simulations and experiments, we extended our simulations to 100 different MOF materials. Several adsorbent evaluation metrics including selectivity, working capacity, adsorption figure of merit, sorbent selection parameter, and percentage regenerability were computed for each MOF and for each gas separation. The rankings of the MOFs based on these metrics were examined in detail to understand which parameters play key roles in assessing the gas separation potential of MOF adsorbents. The results showed that regenerability is a very important metric for screening materials in the first step of the adsorbent search and MOFs can then be ranked according to selectivity. We also examined the relationships between easily computable structural properties of MOFs, such as pore size, surface area, and porosity, and adsorbent evaluation metrics to provide structure--property relationships that can serve as a guide for experimental studies. Materials with pore sizes of 4--7 {\AA}, surface areas of 200--800 m2/g, and porosities of 0.18--0.50 were found to be the best adsorbent candidates for CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/H2 separations. Finally, the kinetic-based separation potentials of the MOFs that were identified as the top-performing materials for adsorption-based separations were analyzed. Both the membrane selectivities and the permeabilities of the MOFs were computed for three gas separation processes. Several MOFs were identified to outperform polymers and zeolites in membrane-based CO2 separations.},

Both methanol and IPA molecules showed a strong preference to gather at various interfaces, with methanol molecules also showing a tendency to diffuse into the droplet bulk. Specific interfacial tensions were investigated using quasi-one-dimensional simulation systems, and liquid-vapor and solid-liquid interfacial tensions were found to decrease greatly due to the presence of interfacial alcohol, while solid-vapor interfacial tensions were proved to have little influence on wettability. Young's relation was found to hold quantitatively well for both water-methanol and water-IPA droplets. The validity of using Bakker's equation on solid-liquid interfaces was also investigated, and it was shown that for tightly spaced crystal surfaces, the introduced uncertainly is small.},

For example, friction, wear and adhesion are known to be central challenges in the design of reliable micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). Because of the complexity of the physical and chemical mechanisms underlying atomic-level tribology, it is still not possible to accurately and reliably predict the response when two surfaces come into contact at the nanoscale. Fundamental scientific studies are the means by which these insights may be gained. We review recent advances in the experimental, theoretical and computational studies of nanotribology. In particular, we focus on the latest developments in atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations and their application to the study of single-asperity contact.},

We have studied binary mixtures of methane with ethane to illustrate the consistency between the simulation methods for bulk fluids, and mixtures of ethanol--water and ammonia-water as examples of adsorption systems. The adsorption systems exhibit cooperative effects between water and ethanol and between water and ammonia: water by itself does not wet a carbon surface, but it adsorbs in large quantities when either ethanol or ammonia are present. Microscopic configurations taken from the simulations show a distinct difference between the adsorption mechanism in the water/ethanol mixtures and the water/ammonia mixtures.},

The overall behaviour indicates that the anharmonic energy terms play a crucial role for the efficiency of the thermostat.},

  abstract = {We construct a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model based on poly(ethylene oxide) and lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide salt to examine the combined effects of temperature and salt concentration on the transport properties. Salt doping notably slows the dynamics of polymer chains and reduces ion diffusivity, resulting in a glass transition temperature increase proportional to the salt concentration. The polymer diffusion is shown to be well represented by a modified Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (M-VFT) equation that accounts for both the temperature and salt concentration dependence. Furthermore, we find that, at any temperature, the concentration dependence of the conductivity is well described by the product of its infinite dilution value and a correction factor accounting for the reduced segmental mobility with increasing salt concentration. These results highlight the important role of polymer segmental mobility in the salt concentration dependence of ion conductivity for temperatures near and above the glass transition.},

The BPP theory is founded on assuming molecules are hard spheres with 1H-1H dipole pairs reorienting randomly; assumptions that are severe in light of modern understanding of liquids. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to this day that the BPP theory was consistent with the original experimental data for glycerol, a hydrogen-bonding molecular fluid for which the hard-sphere-rigid-dipole assumption is inapplicable. To better understand this incongruity, atomistic molecular simulations are used to compute 1H NMR T1 relaxation dispersion (i.e., frequency dependence) in two contrasting cases: glycerol, and a (non hydrogen-bonding) viscosity standard. At high viscosities, simulations predict distinct functional forms of T1 for glycerol compared to the viscosity standard, in agreement with modern measurements, yet both in contrast to BPP theory. The cause of these departures from BPP theory is elucidated, without assuming any relaxation models and without any free parameters, by decomposing the simulated T1 response into dynamic molecular modes for both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. The decomposition into dynamic molecular modes provides an alternative framework to understand the physics of NMR relaxation for viscous fluids.},

One must consider 1) the accuracy of Qexp, 2) the accuracy of the function Q(rN) used to calculate a Q-value based on a molecular configuration rN of N particles, 3) the sensitivity of the function Q(rN) to the configuration rN, 4) the relative time scales of the simulation and experiment, 5) the degree to which the calculated and experimental properties are equivalent, and 6) the degree to which the system simulated matches the experimental conditions. Experimental data is limited in scope and generally corresponds to averages over both time and space. A critical analysis of the various factors influencing the apparent degree of (dis)agreement between simulations and experiment is presented and illustrated using examples from the literature.

  abstract = {The global phase diagram (i.e., vapor--liquid and fluid--solid equilibrium) of two-center Lennard-Jones (2CLJ) model molecules of bond length L={$\sigma$} has been determined by computer simulation. The vapor--liquid equilibrium conditions are obtained using the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo method and by performing isobaric-isothermal NPT calculations at zero pressure. In the case of the solid phase, two close-packed solid structures are considered: In the first structure, the molecules are located in layers and all molecular axes point in the same direction; and in the second structure, the atoms form a close-packed arrangement but the molecular axes of the diatomic molecules have random orientations. It is shown that at the vapor--liquid--solid triple-point temperature, the orientationally disordered solid is the stable structure for the solid phase of this model. The vapor--liquid-disordered solid triple-point temperature of the 2CLJ model, with bond length L={$\sigma$}, is located at T*=0.650(4). This is very close to the triple-point temperature of the Lennard-Jones monomer system (T*=0.687). At very low temperatures, the ordered solid is the stable phase. The vapor-ordered solid-disordered solid triple point is situated at T*=0.282. The simulation data are compared to Wertheim's first-order thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT1) for the fluid and solid phases. It is found that Wertheim's TPT1 not only provides an accurate description of the equation of state in both the fluid and solid phases, but also provides accurate values of the free energies. The prediction of Wertheim's TPT1 for the global phase diagram of the 2CLJ model shows excellent agreement with the simulation results, illustrating the possibility of using Wertheim's perturbation theory to determine not only the vapor--liquid equilibria but also the global phase diagram of simple chain model molecules.},

These models are TIP4P/Ew, TIP4P/2005, and TIP4P/ice and can be considered as modified versions of the TIP4P model. By design TIP4P reproduces the vaporization enthalpy of water at room temperature, whereas TIP4P/Ew and TIP4P/2005 match the temperature of maximum density and TIP4P/ice the melting temperature of water. Recently, the melting point for each of these models has been computed, making it possible for the first time to compute the complete vapor-liquid equilibria curve from the triple point to the critical point. From the coexistence results at high temperature, it is possible to estimate the critical properties of these models. None of them is capable of reproducing accurately the critical pressure or the vapor pressures and densities. Additionally, in the cases of TIP4P and TIP4P/ice the critical temperatures are too low and too high, respectively, compared to the experimental value. However, models accounting for the density maximum of water, such as TIP4P/Ew and TIP4P/2005 provide a better estimate of the critical temperature. In particular, TIP4P/2005 provides a critical temperature just 7K below the experimental result as well as an extraordinarily good description of the liquid densities from the triple point to the critical point. All TIP4P-like models present a ratio of the triple point temperature to the critical point temperature of about 0.39, compared with the experimental value of 0.42. As is the case for any effective potential neglecting many body forces, TIP4P/2005 fails in describing simultaneously the vapor and the liquid phases of water. However, it can be considered as one of the best effective potentials of water for describing condensed phases, both liquid and solid. In fact, it provides a completely coherent view of the phase diagram of water including fluid-solid, solid-solid, and vapor-liquid equilibria.},

The peak of short-lived spurious Hbonds, which results from short-time violations of hydrogen bonding criteria induced by dynamic intermolecular vibrations of molecules, prevails in the types of distributions most often referred to in the literature. A special distribution that appears to have not been used before is proposed. Along with shortlived bonds, it manifests long-lived ones whose lifetime is determined by the genuine, or random, hydrogen bond breaking rather than by dynamic. A technique to exclude dynamic effects and reveal the genuine Hbond breaking is proposed. This allows the evaluation of the average lifetime of ``true'' H-bonds that turns out to exceed 3 ps.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics studies have demonstrated that molecular water at an interface, with either a gas or a solid, displays anisotropic orientational behavior in contrast to its bulk counterpart. This effect has been recently implicated in the like-charge attraction problem for colloidal particles in solution. Here, negatively charged particles in solution display a long-ranged attraction where continuum electrostatic theory predicts monotonically repulsive interactions, particularly in solutions with monovalent salt ions at low ionic strength. Anisotropic orientational behavior of solvent molecules at an interface gives rise to an excess interfacial electrical potential which we suggest generates an additional solvation contribution to the total free energy that is traditionally overlooked in continuum descriptions of interparticle interactions in solution. In the present investigation we perform molecular dynamics simulation based calculations of the interfacial potential using realistic surface models representing various chemistries as well as different solvents. Similar to previous work that focused on simple model surfaces constructed by using oxygen atoms, we find that solvents at more realistic model surfaces exhibit substantial anisotropic orientational behavior. We explore the dependence of the interfacial solvation potential on surface properties such as surface group chemistry and group density at silica and carboxylated polystyrene interfaces. For water, we note surprisingly good agreement between results obtained for a simple O-atom wall and more complex surface models, suggesting a general qualitative consistency of the interfacial solvation effect for surfaces in contact with water. In contrast, for an aprotic solvent such as DMSO, surface chemistry appears to exert a stronger influence on the sign and magnitude of the interfacial solvation potential. The study carries broad implications for molecular-scale interactions and may find relevance in explaining a range of phenomena in softmatter physics and cell biology.},

In fact, it is so popular that the question is rarely asked whether it is fit for purpose. In this paper, we argue that, whilst the LJ potential was designed for noble gases such as argon, it is often used for systems where it is not expected to be particularly realistic. Under those circumstances, the disadvantages of the LJ potential become relevant: most important among these is that in simulations the LJ potential is always modified such that it has a finite range. More seriously, there is by now a whole family of different potentials that are all called Lennard-Jones 12-6, and that are all different -- and that may have very different macroscopic properties. In this paper, we consider alternatives to the LJ 12-6 potential that could be employed under conditions where the LJ potential is only used as a typical short-ranged potential with attraction. We construct a class of potentials that are, in many respects LJ-like but that are by construction finite ranged, vanishing quadratically at the cut-off distance, and that are designed to be computationally cheap. Below, we present this potential and report numerical data for its thermodynamic and transport properties, for the most important cases (cut-off distance rc = 2{$\sigma$} (``LJ-like'') and rc = 1.2{$\sigma$} (a typical ``colloidal'' potential)).},

Herein, we developed a ZIF-62 MOF glass membrane and exploited its intrinsic gas-separation properties. The MOF glass membrane was fabricated by melt-quenching treatment of an in situ solvothermally synthesized polycrystalline ZIF-62 MOF membrane on a porous ceramic alumina support. The molten ZIF-62 phase penetrated into the nanopores of the support and eliminated the formation of intercrystalline defects in the resultant glass membrane. The molecular sieving ability of the MOF membrane is remarkably enhanced via vitrification. The separation factors of the MOF glass membrane for H2/CH4, CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 mixtures are 50.7, 34.5, and 36.6, respectively, far exceeding the Robeson upper bounds.},

  abstract = {CALF-20, a Zn-triazolate-based metal-organic framework (MOF), is one of the most promising adsorbent materials for CO2 capture. However, competitive adsorption of water severely limits its performance when the relative humidity (RH) exceeds 40\%, limiting the potential implementation of CALF-20 in practical settings where CO2 is saturated with moisture, such as postcombustion flue gas. In this work, three newly designed MOFs related to CALF-20, denoted as NU-220, CALF-20M-w, and CALF-20M-e that feature hydrophobic methyltriazolate linkers, are presented. Inclusion of methyl groups in the linker is proposed as a strategy to improve the uptake of CO2 in the presence of water. Notably, both CALF-20M-w and CALF-20M-e retain over 20\% of their initial CO2 capture efficiency at 70\% RH{\dbend}a threshold at which CALF-20 shows negligible CO2 uptake. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the methyl group hinders water network formation in the pores of CALF-20M-w and CALF-20M-e and enhances their CO2 selectivity over N2 in the presence of a high moisture content. Moreover, calculated radial distribution functions indicate that introducing the methyl group into the triazolate linker increases the distance between water molecules and Zn coordination bonds, offering insights into the origin of the enhanced moisture stability observed for CALF-20M-w and CALF-20M-e relative to CALF-20. Overall, this straightforward design strategy has afforded more robust sorbents that can potentially meet the challenge of effectively capturing CO2 in practical industrial applications.},

We find that the proposed shooting algorithm is the most accurate, efficient, and robust for these test cases. In comparison, existing methods based on common model simplifications suffered from large errors and frequent convergence failures for higher component mixtures, while those based on numerical discretization techniques suffered from higher cost and needed much more careful tuning to provide reliable solutions.},

It is found that the effects of these forces are most easily separated by considering the structure factor (or equivalently, the Fourier transform of the pair-correlation function) rather than the pair-correlation function itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of the structure factor; but this effect decreases as the density increases and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions are established by considering the structure factor of a hypothetical reference system in which the intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive forces in a Lennard-Jones fluid. This reference system structure factor is calculated with the aid of a simple but accurate approximation described herein. The conclusions lead to a very simple prescription for calculating the radial distribution function of dense liquids which is more accurate than that obtained by any previously reported theory. The thermodynamic ramifications of the conclusions are presented in the form of calculations of the free energy, the internal energy (from the energy equation), and the pressure (from the virial equation). The implications of our conclusions to perturbation theories for liquids and to the interpretation of x-ray scattering experiments are discussed.},

By combining the density functional theory calculations of energies of fullerenes and single wall carbon nanotubes with the configurational energy of membranes determined by Helfrich Hamiltonian, we have designed a theoretical approach to accurately determine the bending rigidity and Gaussian bending stiffness of single-layered graphene. The bending rigidity and Gaussian bending stiffness of single-layered graphene are 1.44 eV (2.31 {\texttimes} 10-19 N m) and -1.52 eV (2.43 {\texttimes} 10-19 N m), respectively. The bending rigidity is close to the experimental result. Interestingly, the bending stiffness of graphene is close to that of lipid bilayers of cells about 1-2 eV, which might mechanically justify biological applications of graphene.},

  abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks are promising nanoporous materials for adsorption heat pumps (AHPs) using water and alcohols as working fluids due to their ultrahigh surface area. The heat transfer in porous crystals containing adsorbed gases is vital for their performance in adsorbed natural gas storage or AHPs. However, limited attention has been paid to their thermal properties. In this study, equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the impacts of ethanol/water adsorption on the thermal conductivity of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). The results demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of ZIF-8 increased from 0.165 to 0.319 W m-1 K-1 with the increased number of adsorbed ethanol molecules. On the contrary, the thermal conductivity of ZIF-8 upon water adsorption is approximately 0.190 W m-1 K-1, which is not significantly affected by the number of adsorbed water molecules. Such a different tendency may be ascribed to the different interaction strengths between ZIF-8 and gas molecules. In addition, the larger overlap energy in the vibrational density of state of ZIF-8/ethanol than that of ZIF-8/ water also correlates with the higher thermal conductivity of the ZIF-8/ethanol system. This work provides molecular insights into the effects of ethanol/water adsorption on the thermal conductivity of ZIF-8, which may inspire further exploration of novel techniques to improve the heat transfer performance of practical applications.},

In practice, defects resulting from thermodynamics or introduced by fabrication, naturally or artificially, play a pivotal role in the mechanical behaviors of graphene. More importantly, high strength is just one aspect of the magnificent mechanical properties of graphene: its atomic-thin geometry not only leads to ultra-low bending rigidity, but also brings in many other unique properties of graphene in terms of mechanics in contrast to other carbon allotropes, including fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. The out-of-plane deformation is of a `soft' nature, which gives rise to rich morphology and is crucial for morphology control. In this review article, we aim to summarize current theoretical advances in describing the mechanics of defects in graphene and the theory to capture the out-of-plane deformation. The structure--mechanical property relationship in graphene, in terms of its elasticity, strength, bending and wrinkling, with or without the influence of imperfections, is presented.},

The experimental data are quantitatively reproduced in complementary solvent-explicit atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, which yield the chemical potential of water. Simulation analysis reveals that the additional repulsion arises from the osmotic pressure generated by the co-solutes, an effect which is maximal for TMAO, due to its unfavorable interactions with the lipid headgroup layer and its extraordinarily high osmotic coefficient.},

The negative {$\zeta$}-potential of zwitterionic net-neutral phospholipid vesicles in neat water, which changes sign and increases in solutions of NaCl or KCl, is a phenomenon consistently observed in experiments but not fully understood theoretically. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of applied electric fields which drive electroosmotic flows, in combination with an electrostatic continuum model based on the modified Poisson-Boltzmann and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equations, we study the electrokinetic and electrostatic properties as well as the specific ion affinities to the phospholipid-water interface, in order to resolve these puzzling observations. Our modified continuum equations account for the dielectric profile at the lipid-water interface, ion-specific interactions between ions and the lipid-water interface, and the interfacial viscosity profile, which are all extracted from our atomistic simulations and rather accurately predict ion-density and electrostatic-potential distributions as well as {$\zeta$}-potentials in comparison with our atomistic simulations. Our continuum model can explain experimental {$\zeta$}-potentials only when we assume minute amounts of surface-active anionic impurities in the aqueous solution. In fact, the amount of impurities needed to explain the experimental data increases linearly with the salt concentration, suggesting that surface-active species, which might be already present in the lab water or lipid samples, could further be introduced through the added salt.},

In each of these geometries, a dense colloid suspension exhibits pronounced density oscillations with spacing of a particle diameter. We remove the discrepancy between prediction and experiment using the Fisher-Methfessel interpretation of how local equilibrium in an inhomogeneous system is maintained to argue that the force acting on a particle is delocalized over a volume with radius equal to a particle diameter. Our interpretation has relevance to the relationship between the scale of inhomogeneity and the utility of translation of the particle MSD into a position dependent diffusion coefficient and to the use of a spatially dependent diffusion coefficient to describe mass transport in a heterogeneous system.},

Improvements in computational resources, in quality of force field parameters and algorithms have yielded significant improvements in performance and reliability. On the other hand, no method of research is error free. In this review, we discuss a few examples of errors and artifacts due to various sources and discuss how to avoid them. Besides bringing attention to artifacts and proper practices in simulations, we also aim to provide the reader with a starting point to explore these issues further. In particular, we hope that the discussion encourages researchers to check software, parameters, protocols and, most importantly, their own practices in order to minimize the possibility of errors.

Close agreement with Michels is found, but significant disagreement with Bridgman.

We report direct enthalpy of adsorption ({$\Delta$}hads) measurements for ethanol and water vapor on porous silica glass (CPG-10), in both hydroxylated and dehydroxylated (hydrophobic) forms. The results suggest a spectrum of energetics as a function of coverage, stepwise for ethanol but continuous for water. The zero-coverage enthalpy of adsorption for hydroxylated silica shows the most exothermic enthalpies for both water (-72.7 {\textpm} 3.1 kJ/mol water) and ethanol (-78.0 {\textpm} 1.9 kJ/mol ethanol). The water adsorption enthalpy becomes less exothermic gradually until reaching its only plateau (-20.7 {\textpm} 2.2 kJ/mol water) reflecting water clustering on a largely hydrophobic surface, while the enthalpy of ethanol adsorption profile presents two well separated plateaus, corresponding to strong chemisorption of ethanol on adsorbate-free silica surface (-66.4 {\textpm} 4.8 kJ/mol ethanol), and weak physisorption of ethanol on ethanol covered silica (-4.0 {\textpm} 1.6 kJ/mol ethanol). On the other hand, dehydroxylation leads to missing water-silica interactions, whereas the number of ethanol binding sites is not impacted. The isotherms and partial molar properties of adsorption suggest that water may only bind strongly onto the silanols (which are a minor species on silica glass), whereas ethanol can interact strongly with both silanols and the hydrophobic areas of the silica surface.},

  abstract = {In order to introduce flexibility into the simple point-charge (SPC) water model, the impact of the intramolecular degrees of freedom on liquid properties was systematically studied in this work as a function of many possible parameter sets. It was found that the diffusion constant is extremely sensitive to the equilibrium bond length and that this effect is mainly due to the strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The static dielectric constant was found to be very sensitive to the equilibrium bond angle via the distribution of intermolecular angles in the liquid: A larger bond angle will increase the angle formed by two molecular dipoles, which is particularly significant for the first solvation shell. This result is in agreement with the work of H{\"o}chtl et al. [J. Chem. Phys.\hphantom{,}109, 4927 (1998)]. A new flexible simple point-charge water model was derived by optimizing bulk diffusion and dielectric constants to the experimental values via the equilibrium bond length and angle. Due to the large sensitivities, the parametrization only slightly perturbs the molecular geometry of the base SPC model. Extensive comparisons of thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic properties indicate that the new model is much improved over the standard SPC model and its overall performance is comparable to or even better than the extended SPC model.},

The parameters for the 2-methyl imidazole (MeIM) ring are adopted from the AMBER force field, while the van der Waals (VDW) parameters for organic linkers and metal centers were determined by rescaling the UFF parameters as               {$\varepsilon$}               = 0.635               {$\varepsilon$}               UFF               and               {$\sigma$}               = 1.0               {$\sigma$}               UFF               to fit the CH               4               adsorption isotherms obtained by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with the force field parameters to the experimental ones. The CH               4               adsorption isotherms on four different structures of ZIF-8 at 298 K obtained by GCMC simulations are compared with the experimental data. The results show that the simulated CH               4               adsorption isotherms on the ZIF-8 structure reported from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) are closest to the ones on the ZIF-8 structure from the report of Moggach               et al.               To test our model, adsorption isotherms of CH               4               , H               2               , CO               2               and N               2               at different temperatures were computed using GCMC simulations, and the results were found to be in a good agreement with the experimental data. In the case of H               2               , the equilibrium configurations obtained by GCMC simulations were statistically analyzed with ad hoc code to get probability density distribution profiles. These profiles were transformed to visual slice images, which indicate that the preferential adsorption sites of H               2               molecules in ZIF-8 are located close to the MeIM rings, where the host--guest VDW or electrostatic interactions are maximal, as revealed by the potential energy surfaces (PES). In addition, these force field parameters were confirmed to well reproduce the ZIF-8 structural properties including lattice constants, bond lengths and angles over a wide range of temperatures. The self-diffusivities at the specific loadings of adsorbed gases (CH               4               , H               2               and CO               2               ) in ZIF-8 were calculated by the mean squared displacement (MSD) method. It was found that our self-diffusivities of H               2               are slightly higher than the ones in the literature, and our self-diffusivity of CO               2               is as about three times as the one in the literature, due to the different partial charges and the effect of different force field parameters on framework shape and flexibility in our simulations.},

  abstract = {A methodology based on the combination of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and expanded ensemble (EE) simulations has been used to study the adsorption of alcohols from dilute aqueous solution onto the silicalite zeolite. The chemical potential of the guest alcohol molecules in bulk aqueous solutions is calculated by the EE method, and the adsorption isotherms of the alcohols are calculated using GCMC simulations. This approach results in adsorption isotherms that relate the loadings to external concentrations without using an equation of state, experimental data, or performing computationally expensive simulations such as two-phase Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC). Also, the method is ``force-field-consistent'', in that the same force field is used for the bulk fluid and the adsorption calculations, and the resulting isotherms can be directly compared with experimental data. We have established the validity of the method used by comparing the calculated adsorption isotherms with experimental data for methanol and ethanol on silicalite, both from aqueous solution and from the vapor phase. Calculated heats of adsorption are also in reasonable agreement with experimental data. In addition, these simulations provide information on the location of the alcohol adsorption sites. We also observe that the presence of water increases the adsorption of alcohols at dilute concentrations onto silicalite; therefore, an accurate estimate of amount of water adsorbed in the nanoporous substrate is important to the prediction of alcohol adsorption from aqueous solution. The method presented here can be used to study the adsorption of any molecular species on any nanoporous adsorbent.},

Sol gel derived organosilica RO membranes reject isopropanol with rejection higher than 95\%, demonstrating superior molecular sieving ability for neutral solutes of low molecular weight. Due to the introduction of an inherently stable hybrid network structure, the membrane withstands higher temperatures in comparison with commercial polyamide RO membranes, and is resistant to water to at least 90 {$^\circ$}C with no obvious changes in filtration performance. Furthermore, both an accelerated chlorine-resistance test and Fourier transform infrared analysis confirm excellent chlorine stability in this material, which demonstrates promise for a new generation of chlorine-resistant RO membrane materials.},

Here, we report a molecular simulation study to investigate OSN through six PIMs (pristine PIM-1 and five functional PIMs). The permeabilities of four organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and acetone) through PIM-1 are found to correlate well with a combination of membrane and solvent properties. In the presence of a solute (mometasone furoate), the predicted solvent permeabilities through PIM-1 agree well with available experimental data. The solute is 100\% rejected in all the solvents; however, it has different effects on solvent permeation. For protic solvents (methanol and ethanol), the permeabilities are marginally reduced by the solute; this is attributed to the favourable interaction between the solute and protic solvent, thus the solute is less accumulated at the membrane interface. Upon substituting the cyano groups in PIM-1 by various functional groups (hydroxyl, amine, amidoxime, tetrazole and carboxyl), the functional PIMs generally exhibit larger swelling degrees in methanol and higher methanol permeability, surpassing many existing OSN membranes. This simulation study provides microscopic insights into the effects of functionalization on OSN and reveals the complex interplay of solute-solvent-membrane interactions in governing OSN performance.},

  abstract = {Heavy oil (bitumen) is characterized by its high viscosity and density, which is a major obstacle to both well logging and recovery. Due to the lost information of T2 relaxation time shorter than echo spacing (TE) and interference of water signal, estimation of heavy oil properties from NMR T2 measurements is usually problematic. In this work, a new method has been developed to overcome the echo spacing restriction of NMR spectrometer during the application to heavy oil (bitumen). A FID measurement supplemented the start of CPMG. Constrained by its initial magnetization (M0) estimated from the FID and assuming log normal distribution for bitumen, the corrected T2 relaxation time of bitumen sample can be obtained from the interpretation of CPMG data. This new method successfully overcomes the TE restriction of the NMR spectrometer and is nearly independent on the TE applied in the measurement. This method was applied to the measurement at elevated temperatures (8-90 degrees C). Due to the significant signal-loss within the dead time of FID, the directly extrapolated M0 of bitumen at relatively lower temperatures ({$<$}60 degrees C) was found to be underestimated. However, resulting from the remarkably lowered viscosity, the extrapolated M0 of bitumen at over 60 degrees C can be reasonably assumed to be the real value. In this manner, based on the extrapolation at higher temperatures ({$>$} or = 60 degrees C), the M0 value of bitumen at lower temperatures ({$<$}60 degrees C) can be corrected by Curie's Law. Consequently, some important petrophysical properties of bitumen, such as hydrogen index (HI), fluid content and viscosity were evaluated by using corrected T2.},

For all of the alcohol--water mixtures, the maximum value in the adsorption isotherm, namely, the maximum surface excess is about that expected for the formation of a monolayer. Furthermore, the composition of the mixture for the maximum surface excess coincides with that corresponding to the minimum in the excess partial molar volume of the solutes. These results indicate that the hydrophobic hydration in bulk induces the surface excess of the alcohols and after a monolayer is formed, the hydrophobic hydration itself is no longer retained.},

  abstract = {An analytical derivation of the vibrational density of states (DOS) of liquids, and in particular of its characteristic linear in frequency low-energy regime, has always been elusive because of the presence of an infinite set of purely imaginary modes -- the instantaneous normal modes (INMs). By combining an analytic continuation of the Plemelj identity to the complex plane with the purely overdamped dynamics of the INMs, we derive a closed-form analytic expression for the low-frequency DOS of liquids. The obtained result explains from first principles the widely observed linear in frequency term of the DOS in liquids, whose slope appears to increase with the average lifetime of the INMs. The analytic results are robustly confirmed by fitting simulations data for Lennard-Jones liquids, and they also recover the Arrhenius law for the average relaxation time of the INMs, as expected.},

  abstract = {We employ the popular all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulations, OPLSAA, force-field to model 17 different alcohols in the liquid state. Using the standard simulation protocol for few hundred nanosecond time periods, we find that 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol undergo spontaneous transition to a crystalline state at temperatures which are 35-55 K higher than the experimental melting temperatures. Nevertheless, the crystal structures obtained from the simulations are very similar to those determined by X-ray powder diffraction data for several n-alcohols. Although some degree of deviations from the experimental freezing points are to be expected, for 1-nonanol and 1-decanol, the elevation of the freezing temperature warrants special attention because at room temperature, these alcohols are liquids; however, if simulated by the OPLSAA force-field, they will crystallize. This behavior is likely a consequence of exaggerated attractive interactions between the alkane chains of the alcohols. To circumvent this problem, we combined the OPLSAA model with the L-OPLS force-field. We adopted the L-OPLS parameters to model the hydrocarbon tail of the alcohols, whereas the hydroxyl head group remained as in the original OPLSAA force-field. The resulting alcohols stayed in the liquid state at temperatures above their experimental melting points, thus, resolving the enhanced freezing observed with the OPLSAA force-field. In fact, the mixed-model alcohols did not exhibit any spontaneous freezing even at temperatures much lower than the experimental values. However, a series of simulations in which these mixed-OPLSAA alcohols started from a coexistence configuration of the liquid and solid phases resulted in freezing transitions at temperatures 14-25 K lower than the experimental values, confirming the validity of the proposed model. For all of the other alcohols, the mixed model yields results very similar to the OPLSAA force-field and is in good agreement with the experimental data. Thus, for simulating alcohols in the liquid phase, the mixed-OPLSAA model is necessary for large (7 carbons and above) hydrocarbon chains.},

The experiments in ternary systems containing one hydrotropic cosolvent were ambiguous, and therefore, there was no need to come up with a general theory. Recent evidence obtained by specific deuteration in neutron scattering established the need for the extension of self-assembly theories based on Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeck theory (DLVO), bending, or phase transfer energy. Here, we introduce a general free energy expression for weak self-assembly, where solvation effects and entropy compete without the influence of film bending, that explains all experimental results for this class of microemulsions.           ,                             Ternary solutions containing one hydrotrope (such as ethanol) and two immiscible fluids, both being soluble in the hydrotrope at any proportion, show unexpected solubilization power and allow strange but yet unexplained membrane enzyme activity. We study the system ethanol-water-octanol as a simple model of such kinds of ternary solutions. The stability of ``detergentless'' micelles or microemulsions in such mixtures was proposed in the pioneering works of Barden and coworkers [Smith GD, Donelan CE, Barden RE (1977)               J Colloid Interface Sci               60(3):488--496 and Keiser BA, Varie D, Barden RE, Holt SL (1979)               J Phys Chem               83(10):1276--1281] in the 1970s and then, neglected, because no general explanation for the observations was available. Recent direct microstructural evidence by light, X-ray, and neutron scattering using contrast variation reopened the debate. We propose here a general principle for solubilization without conventional surfactants: the balance between hydration force and entropy. This balance explains the stability of microemulsions in homogeneous ternary mixtures based on cosolvents.},

Full isotherms (0.05-0.95 activity) over the range 25- 55 {$^\circ$}C are presented, and the lowest total water uptake ever reported in the literature is shown for silicalite-1 made via a fluoride-mediated route wherein internal silanol defects are significantly reduced. At a water activity level of 0.95 (35 {$^\circ$}C), the total water uptake by silicalite-1 (F-) was found to be 0.263 mmol/g, which was only 12.6\%, 9.8\%, and 3.3\% of the capacity for silicalite-1 (OH-), H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al:140), and H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al:15), respectively, under the same conditions. While water adsorption shows distinct isotherms for different MFI-type zeolites due to the difference in the concentration, distribution, and types of hydrophilic sites, the ethanol adsorption isotherms present relatively comparable results because of the overall organophilic nature of the zeolite framework. Due to the dramatic differences in the sorption behavior with the different sorbate-sorbent pairs, different models are applied to correlate and analyze the sorption isotherms. An adsorption potential theory was used to fit the water adsorption isotherms on all MFI-type zeolite adsorbents studied. The Langmuir model and Sircar's model are applied to describe ethanol adsorption on silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 samples, respectively. An ideal ethanol/water adsorption selectivity ({$\alpha$}) was estimated for the fluoride-mediated silicalite-1. At 35 {$^\circ$}C, {$\alpha$} was estimated to be 36 for a 5 mol \% ethanol solution in water increasing to 53 at an ethanol concentration of 1 mol \%. The adsorption data demonstrate that silicalite-1 made via the fluoride-mediated route is a promising candidate for ethanol extraction from dilute ethanol-water solutions.},

ZIF-8 exhibits extremely low water uptakes. At 35 {$^\circ$}C and a relative pressure (P/Po) of 0.95, the water uptakes for 324, 15.8, and 0.4 {$\mu$}m ZIF-8 are 0.184, 0.197, and 0.503 mmol/g, respectively, all of which are less than 1 wt \% increase relative to original sorbent mass (0.33, 0.35, 0.91 wt \%). For ethanol adsorption, ZIF-8 exhibits an S-shape isotherm with low ethanol uptakes at P/Po up to 0.08 and the cage filling phenomenon occurs at P/Po higher than 0.08. The ethanol saturation uptake in ZIF-8 is as high as 30\% of the sorbent weight. Because of the existence of the hydrophilic -N-H functionality introduced by the terminating imidazolate (Im) linker and the overall hydrophobicity of the inner network, the effect of outer surface area of ZIF-8 crystals is proved to be non-negligible as ZIF-8 crystals becomes smaller despite the extremely large inner surface area and pore volume, especially for water sorption. The variation of isosteric heats of adsorption for water reveals the existence of structural defect of ZIF-8 framework. Transport diffusivity and corrected diffusivity for water and ethanol in ZIF-8 are determined within the entire P/Po range. The ethanol/water separation performance in ZIF-8 is evaluated in terms of vaporphase sorption selectivity and permselectivity. While ZIF-8 exhibits ample ethanol/water sorption selectivity, it is not effective for ethanol extraction as a membrane material from dilute ethanol aqueous solutions due to the unfavorable diffusion selectivity and the competitive water uptakes in the adsorbed ethanol phase.},

  abstract = {The wettability of a polymer surface{\dbend}related to its hydrophobicity or tendency to repel water{\dbend}can be crucial for determining its utility, such as for a coating or a purification membrane. While wettability is commonly associated with the macroscopic measurement of a contact angle between surface, water, and air, the molecular physics that underlie these macroscopic observations are not fully known, and anticipating the relative behavior of different polymers is challenging. To address this gap in molecular-level understanding, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate and contrast interactions of water with six chemically distinct polymers: polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, poly(methyl methacrylate), Nylon-66, and poly(vinyl alcohol). We show that several prospective quantitative metrics for hydrophobicity agree well with experimental contact angles. Moreover, the behavior of water in proximity to these polymer surfaces can be distinguished with analysis of interfacial water dynamics, extent of hydrogen bonding, and molecular orientation{\dbend}even when macroscopic measures of hydrophobicity are similar. The predominant factor dictating wettability is found to be the extent of hydrogen bonding between polymer and water, but the precise manifestation of hydrogen bonding and its impact on surface water structure varies. In the absence of hydrogen bonding, other molecular interactions and polymer mechanics control hydrophobic ordering. These results provide new insights into how polymer chemistry specifically impacts water-polymer interactions and translates to surface hydrophobicity. Such factors may facilitate the design or processing of polymer surfaces to achieve targeted wetting behavior, and presented analyses can be useful in studying the interfacial physics of other systems.},

Detailed analysis on the energetics of the host-guest complexation demonstrates that flexibility of the binding partners and solvation-related {$\Delta$}H and {$\Delta$}S need to be included explicitly for accurate estimation of the binding thermodynamics. From this, and our previous work on the solvent dependency of binding energies (Zhang et al. J. Phys. Chem.

Molecular dynamics simulation studies with the water-2017 force field support the Eigen--Zundel--Eigen mechanism for PT in acidic aqueous solution and reproduce the hypercoordinated solvation structure of the OH-- in a basic environment. In particular, it predicts the correct order of the diffusion constants of H2O, H3O+, and OH-- and their values are in agreement with the experimental data. Another interesting observation is that the diffusion constants of H3O+ and OH-- are close to each other at high concentration due to the strong correlation between OH-- ions in basic aqueous solution. On the basis of our results, it is shown that ReaxFF provides a novel approach to study the complex acid--base chemical reactions in aqueous solution with any pH value.},

This study, using molecular dynamics, formulates a semiempirical model based on theoretical considerations and factorization that offer an alternative view of diffusion and its link with the structure and behavior (sorption and deformation) of material. By analyzing the intermittent dynamics of water, microscopic self-diffusion coefficients are predicted. The apparent tortuosity, defined as the ratio of the bulk to the confined self-diffusion coefficients, is found to depend quantitatively on a limited set of material parameters: heat of adsorption, elastic modulus, and percolation probability, all of which are experimentally accessible.

  abstract = {Selective polymer membranes are one of the most promising materials to achieve large-scale and energy-efficient mass separation and energy conversion. However, their performance is subject to the selectivity--permeability trade-off. To overcome this trade-off and achieve high-performance ion separation, it is essential to fabricate thin membranes with a high density of uniformly sized nanopores with the pore size at around 1\,nm. However, it has been challenging to precisely control the pore size at about 1\,nm. In this Tutorial, we outline the underlying mechanism for selective ion transport through nanopores, especially the emerging mechanism as the nanopore size is tuned around 1\,nm. Then, we review the recent development of the main fabrication methods of selective polymer membranes from either the top--down approach or the bottom--up approach, especially the novel techniques generating uniformly sized nanopores with nanometric or even subnanometric size. Finally, we discuss the future development of the design and fabrication of the selective polymer membranes to fulfill their potential in real applications.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to study ethanol-water mixtures and the corresponding pure species, confined within slit-shaped graphene nanopores. Extensive structural and dynamical properties of the confined fluids, including hydrogen-bonding behavior, were investigated. The effects of pore width and mixture composition on the confined behavior were illustrated. It is observed that a layered structure is formed within the confined spaces and the ethanol- water mixtures show segregation at larger pores, with ethanol molecules preferentially adsorbing on graphene surfaces. This microphase demixing behavior stems from the competitive effect of the solid-fluid and fluid-fluid interactions. Moreover, miscellaneous diffusion mechanisms have been revealed for the hydrogen-bonding mixtures within the graphene pores. In the mixtures, water and ethanol generally display analogous diffusion mechanism due to ethanol-water association, converting from short-time subdiffusion to long-time Fickian diffusion in the larger nanopores. In the smaller pore (7 {\AA}), both ethanol and water show a suppressed single-file diffusion behavior at the initial time and then display subdiffusion or single-file diffusion behavior. The complex diffusion behavior of ethanol-water mixtures can be described by the collaborating effects of pore confinement and enhanced interaction in the hydrogen-bonding mixtures.},

Here we present a full set of force field parameters, based on the AMBER database and on previously computed partial charges, well reproducing the ZIF-8 structural properties over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. To test our model, the self-diffusivity for sorbed carbon-dioxide is computed and is found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements. Our results are also compared to the ones obtained with other charge models and are found to be more accurate. Finally, an estimate of the influence on self-diffusion of various simulation details is given.},

  abstract = {We present a successful hierarchical modeling approach which accounts for interface effects on diffusivity, ignored in classical continuum theories. A molecular dynamics derived diffusivity scaling scheme is incorporated into a finite element method to model transport through a nanochannel. In a 5 nm nanochannel, the approach predicts 2.2 times slower mass release than predicted by Fick's law by comparing time spent to release 90\% of mass. The scheme was validated by predicting experimental glucose diffusion through a nanofluidic membrane with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. Comparison with experiments through a nanofluidic membrane showed interface effects to be crucial. We show robustness of our discrete continuum model in addressing complex diffusion phenomena in biomedical and engineering applications by providing flexible hierarchical coupling of molecular scale effects and preserving computational finite element method speed.},

  abstract = {Quasielastic neutron scattering by employing a combination of time-of-flight and backscattering techniques is carried out to explore the molecular mobility of a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1) on microscopic timescales in comparison with a high-performance polyimide. Molecular fluctuations can change the structure of the temporary network of micropores and open or close pathways for gas molecules. Therefore, the investigation might help to understand the selectivity of PIMs in gas separation processes. The performed neutron scattering experiments provide evidence for a low-temperature relaxation process, which was assigned to methyl group rotation. This methyl group rotation was analyzed in terms of jump diffusion in a threefold potential. The analysis results in a fraction of methyl groups, which are immobilized. For PIM-1, it was found that the fraction of immobilized methyl groups decreases with increasing temperature up to 350 K. At higher temperatures, the number of immobilized methyl group increases gain due to an underlying relaxation process. This motional process on a somewhat larger length scale might lead to a reversible structural rearrangement, which partially hinders the strongly localized methyl group rotation. In addition, it was found that the activation energies for the methyl group rotation for PIM-1 and the polyimide are significantly higher than that for conventional polymers.},

Developing nanosheet membranes with hydrophobic surfaces and/or with a minimal surface silanol density represents the keys to enable highly selective separation processes.},
