The objective of this tutorial is to use the open-source code GROMACS
:cite:`van2005gromacs` to perform a molecular dynamics simulation. The
system consists of a bulk solution of water mixed with sodium
(:math:`\text{Na}_+`) and sulfate (:math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}`) ions.

This tutorial guides you through setting up a simulation box,
adding species to it, and then solvating them with water.
It also introduces key components of molecular
dynamics simulations, including energy minimization, thermostating, and
both :math:`NVT` and :math:`NpT` equilibration steps. The resulting trajectory
is analyzed using GROMACS utilities, radial distribution functions are
extracted, and the trajectories are visualized using VMD :cite:`humphrey1996vmd`.

    The input files
    ===============
    In order to run the present simulation using GROMACS, we need to
    prepare the following three files (or sets of files):

    - 1) A **configuration file** (**.gro**) containing the initial positions of
    the atoms and the box dimensions.

    - 2) A **topology file** (**.top**) specifying the location of the force
    field files (**.itp**) and the number of residues in the simulation.

    - 3) An **input file** (**.mdp**) containing the simulation parameters
    (e.g., imposed temperature, timestep, and cut-off values).

    ..
        The specificity of the present tutorial is that both configuration
        and topology files were prepared with homemade Python scripts, see
        :ref:`create-conf-label`. In principle, it is also possible to
        prepare the system using GROMACS functionalities, such as 
        *gmx pdb2gmx*, *gmx trjconv*, or *gmx solvate*. This will be done
        in the next tutorial, :ref:`protein_electrolyte-label`.

Populating the box
==================

Let us create the simulation box by placing the ions and molecules into it. To do  
so, we start from an empty box. In a dedicated folder, create an empty file  
called |empty.gro|, and copy the following lines into it:

..  code-block:: bw

    Cubic box
    0
    3.50000   3.50000   3.50000

.. |empty.gro| raw:: html

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacstutorials/gromacstutorials-inputs/main/tutorial1/empty.gro" target="_blank">empty.gro</a>

The first line, *Cubic box*, is a comment; the second line indicates the total
number of atoms (0); and the last line defines the box dimensions in
nanometers -- in this case, 3.5 by 3.5 by :math:`3.5~\text{nm}`. This **.gro** file
is written in |Gromos87| format.

.. |Gromos87| raw:: html

    <a href="https://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.4/online/gro.html" target="_blank">Gromos87</a>

Let us populate this empty box with :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}` ions first. To do so,
the GROMACS command named ``insert-molecules`` is used, for which one needs to
provide a template for the ion. Within the same folder as **empty.gro**, create a
new file named |so4.gro|, and copy the following lines into it:

..  code-block:: bw

    SO4 ion
    5
        1  SO4   O1    1   0.608   1.089   0.389
        1  SO4   O2    2   0.562   1.181   0.150
        1  SO4   O3    3   0.388   1.217   0.339
        1  SO4   O4    4   0.425   0.980   0.241
        1  SO4   S1    5   0.496   1.117   0.280
    1.00000   1.00000   1.00000

.. |so4.gro| raw:: html

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacstutorials/gromacstutorials-inputs/main/tutorial1/so4.gro" target="_blank">so4.gro</a>

This topology file for the :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}` ion is written in the same |Gromos87|
format as **empty.gro**. It contains 5 atoms named ``O1``, ``O2``, ``O3``, ``O4``,
and ``S1``, all grouped in a residue called ``SO4``.

Let us call the ``gmx insert-molecules`` command by typing in the terminal:

..  code-block:: bw

    gmx insert-molecules -ci so4.gro -f empty.gro -o conf.gro -nmol 6 -radius 0.5

Here, the ``insert-molecules`` command of GROMACS uses **empty.gro** as an input (flag ``-f``),
and create a new **.gro** file named **conf.gro** (flag ``-o``) with 6 ions in it (flag ``-nmol``).
The ``-radius 0.5`` option is used to prevent ions for being inserted closer than
:math:`0.5~\text{nm}` from each other. The output should indicate that the 
insertion were successful:

..  code-block:: bw

    Added 6 molecules (out of 6 requested)
    Writing generated configuration to conf.gro

Looking at the generated **conf.gro** file, it contains 30 atoms corresponding
to the 6 ions:

..  code-block:: bw

    Cubic box
    30
        1SO4     O1    1   2.231   2.698   0.397
        1SO4     O2    2   2.008   2.825   0.356
        1SO4     O3    3   2.009   2.566   0.370
        1SO4     O4    4   2.115   2.685   0.165
        1SO4     S1    5   2.091   2.693   0.322
        (...)
        6SO4     O1   26   1.147   3.194   0.656
        6SO4     O2   27   1.107   3.341   0.446
        6SO4     O3   28   1.349   3.274   0.514
        6SO4     O4   29   1.216   3.444   0.658
        6SO4     S1   30   1.205   3.313   0.568
    3.50000   3.50000   3.50000

Between the second and the last lines, there is one line per atom. Each line
indicates, from left to right:

- the residue ID, with all 5 atoms from the same :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}` ion
  sharing the same residue ID,
- the residue name (SO4),
- the atom name (O1, O2, O3, O4, or S1),
- the atom ID (1 to 30),
- the atom position: :math:`x`, :math:`y`, and :math:`z` coordinates in
  nanometers.
    
The format of a **.gro** file is fixed, and each column is in a fixed position.

The generated **conf.gro** file can be visualized using VMD by typing in the
terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    vmd conf.gro

Then, download the |na.gro| template for the :math:`\text{Na}_+` ion and add
12 ions using the same command:

..  code-block:: bw

    gmx insert-molecules -ci na.gro -f conf.gro -o conf.gro -nmol 12 -radius 0.5

.. |na.gro| raw:: html

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacstutorials/gromacstutorials-inputs/main/tutorial1/na.gro" target="_blank">na.gro</a>

Here, importantly, the same **conf.gro** file is used as input (``-f``) and
output (``-o``), so the 12 ions will be added to the same file. Finally,
download the |h2o.gro| template for the :math:`\text{H}_2\text{O}` molecule and
add 800 molecules using the same command:

..  code-block:: bw

    gmx insert-molecules -ci h2o.gro -f conf.gro -o conf.gro -nmol 800 -radius 0.14

.. |h2o.gro| raw:: html

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacstutorials/gromacstutorials-inputs/main/tutorial1/h2o.gro" target="_blank">h2o.gro</a>

The final **conf.gro** file contains :

..  code-block:: bw

    Figure: :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}` ions, :math:`\text{Na}_+` ions, and water molecules.
    Oxygen atoms are in red, hydrogen in white, sodium in blue, and sulfur in
    yellow. For easier visualization, water molecules are represented as sticks.

The molecules and ions have been placed randomly in space, and
are therefore arranged in a quite unrealistic manner. This will be
fixed during energy minimization.

Set the parameters
==================

Parameters for the interactions of the different atoms and molecules are
provided in the topology files (**.top** and **.itp**). These parameters
include the non-bonded interactions, :math:`V_{\text{nb}}(r)`, which are modeled as a
combination of Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials:

.. math::

   V_{\text{nb}}(r) = 4\varepsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_{ij}} \right)^{12}
   - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_{ij}} \right)^6 \right] + \frac{q_i q_j}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r_{ij}}

where:

- :math:`r_{ij}` is the distance between particles :math:`i` and :math:`j`,
- :math:`\varepsilon` is the depth of the Lennard-Jones potential well,
- :math:`\sigma` is the distance at which the Lennard-Jones potential is zero,
- :math:`q_i` and :math:`q_j` are the charges of particles :math:`i` and :math:`j`,
- :math:`\varepsilon_0` is the vacuum permittivity.

The parameters from the **.top** and **.itp** files also describe the bonded
interactions that are used to join atoms from the same residues, typically using
combinations of harmonic potentials or similar functional forms.

First, the |topol-SO4.top| file must be placed in the same folder as the
**conf.gro** file. It contains the following lines:

.. |topol-SO4.top| raw:: html

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacstutorials/gromacstutorials-inputs/main/tutorial1/bulk-solution/topol.top" target="_blank">topol.top</a>

..  code-block:: bw

    #include "ff/forcefield.itp"
    #include "ff/h2o.itp"
    #include "ff/na.itp"
    #include "ff/so4.itp"

    [ System ]
    Na2SO4 solution

    [ Molecules ]
    SO4 6
    Na 12
    SOL 700

The first four lines are used to include the values of the parameters that are
provided in four separate files (**forcefield.itp**, **h2o.itp**, **na.itp**,
**so4.itp**) located in the **ff/** folder (see below). The rest of
the **topol.top** file contains the system name (here,
*Na2SO4 solution*), and the list of the residues. Here, there are
6 :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}` ions, 12 :math:`\text{Na}_+` ions, and
700 water molecules.

.. admonition:: About topol.top
    :class: info

    It is crucial that the order and number of residues in the
    topology file match the order of the **conf.gro** file.

Create a folder named **ff/** next to the **conf.gro** and the **topol.top**
files, and copy the four following files into it:

- |forcefield.itp|
- |h2o.itp|
- |na.itp|
- |so4.itp|

These four files contain information about the atoms (names, masses, charges,
Lennard-Jones coefficients) and residues (bond and angular constraints) for all
the species involved in the system.

.. |forcefield.itp| raw:: html

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacstutorials/gromacstutorials-inputs/main/level1/bulk-solution/ff/forcefield.itp" target="_blank">forcefield.itp</a>

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacstutorials/gromacstutorials-inputs/main/level1/bulk-solution/ff/h2o.itp" target="_blank">h2o.itp</a>

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacstutorials/gromacstutorials-inputs/main/level1/bulk-solution/ff/na.itp" target="_blank">na.itp</a>

    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromacstutorials/gromacstutorials-inputs/main/level1/bulk-solution/ff/so4.itp" target="_blank">so4.itp</a>

More specifically, the **forcefield.itp** file contains a line that specifies
the combination rules as ``comb-rule 2``, which corresponds to the well-known
Lorentz-Berthelot rule :cite:`lorentz1881ueber,berthelot1898melange`, where:
:math:`\epsilon_{ij} = \sqrt{\epsilon_{ii} \epsilon_{jj}}, \sigma_{ij} = \frac{\sigma_{ii} + \sigma_{jj}}{2}`.
In **forcefield.itp**, this rule is specified as:

..  code-block:: bw

    [ defaults ]
    ; nbfunc  comb-rule  gen-pairs  fudgeLJ  fudgeQQ
    1       2          no         1.0      0.833
    
Here, the ``fudge`` parameters specify how the pair interaction between fourth
neighbors in a residue are handled, which is not relevant for the small
residues considered here. The **forcefield.itp** file also contains the list
of atoms, and their respective charge in units of the elementary charge
:math:`e`, as well as their respective Lennard-Jones parameters :math:`\sigma`
(in nanometers) and :math:`\epsilon` (in kJ/mol):

..  code-block:: bw

    [ atomtypes ]
    ; name  at.num  mass      charge  ptype  sigma    epsilon
    Na    11      22.9900   1.0000  A      0.23100  0.45000

    MW     0       0.0000  -1.0540  D      0.00000  0.00000

Here, ``ptype`` is used to differentiate the real atoms (A), such as
hydrogens and oxygens, from the virtual and massless site of the
four-point water model (D).

Finally, the **h2o.itp**, **na.itp**, and **so4.itp** files contain information
about the residues, such as their exact compositions, which pairs of atoms
are connected by bonds, as well as the parameters for these bonds. In the case
of the :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}`, for instance, the sulfur atom forms a bond of
equilibrium distance :math:`0.152~\text{nm}` and rigidity constant
:math:`3.7656 \times 10^4~\text{kJ/mol/nm}^2` with each of the four oxygen atoms:

..  code-block:: bw

        2    5    1   0.1520   3.7656e4
        3    5    1   0.1520   3.7656e4
        4    5    1   0.1520   3.7656e4

Energy minimization
===================

To run GROMACS, one needs to prepare an input file that contains instructions
about the simulation, such as:

- the number of steps to perform,
- the thermostat to be used (e.g. Langevin :cite:`schneider1978molecular`,
  Berendsen :cite:`berendsen1984molecular`),
- the cut-off for the interactions,
- the integrator or algorithms (e.g. steepest-descent
  :cite:`debye1909naherungsformeln`, leap-frog :cite:`allen2017computer`).

It is clear from the configuration (**.gro**) file that the molecules and
ions are currently in a quite unphysical configuration. It would be risky to
directly start the molecular dynamics simulation, as atoms would undergo huge
forces and accelerate, potentially causing the system to explode.

To bring the system into a more favorable state, let us perform an energy
minimization, which consists of moving the atoms until the forces between them
are reasonable.

Open a blank file, call it **min.mdp**, and save it in a new folder named
**inputs/**, located alongside **ff/** and **topol.top**:

.. figure:: ../figures/level1/bulk-solution/gromacs_inputs-light.png
    :alt: Gromacs files and structure folder

    :height: 200
    :class: only-dark

.. container:: figurelegend

    Figure: Structure of the folder containing the **.itp**, **.gro**, and **.top** files.

Copy the following lines into **min.mdp**:

.. code-block:: bw

    integrator = steep
    nsteps = 5000

These two lines are GROMACS commands. The ``integrator`` specifies to GROMACS
that the algorithm to be used is the |steepest-descent|, which moves the atoms
following the direction of the largest forces until one of the stopping criteria
is reached :cite:`debye1909naherungsformeln`. The ``nsteps`` command specifies
the maximum number of steps to perform, here 5000.

.. |steepest-descent| raw:: html

    <a href="https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/algorithms/energy-minimization.html" target="_blank">steepest-descent</a>

To visualize the trajectory of the atoms during the minimization, let us also
add the following command to the input file:

.. code-block:: bw

    nstxout = 10

The ``nstxout`` command requests GROMACS to print the atom positions every 10
steps. The trajectory will be printed in a compressed **.trr** trajectory file
that can be read by VMD or Ovito.

Let us run that input script using GROMACS. From the terminal, type:

..  code-block:: bash

    gmx grompp -f inputs/min.mdp -c conf.gro -o min -pp min -po min
    gmx mdrun -v -deffnm min

The ``grompp`` command is used to preprocess the files in order to prepare
the simulation. This command also checks the validity of the files. By using
the ``-f`` and ``-c`` keywords, we specify which input file must be used, as
well as the initial configuration, i.e., the initial positions of the atoms.
The other keywords ``-o``, ``-pp``, and ``-po`` are used to specify the names
of the outputs that will be produced during the run.

The ``mdrun`` command calls the engine performing the computation from the
preprocessed files, which is recognized thanks to the ``-deffnm`` keyword. The
``-v`` option enables *verbose* mode so that more information is printed in
the terminal.

If everything works, information should be printed in the terminal, including:

..  code-block:: bw

    Steepest Descents converged to machine precision in 534 steps,
    but did not reach the requested Fmax < 10.
    Potential Energy  = -4.9832715e+04
    Maximum force     =  4.4285486e+02 on atom 30
    Norm of force     =  4.6696228e+01

The information printed in the terminal indicates that energy minimization
has been performed, even though the precision requested by the default
parameters was not reached. We can ignore this message, as long as the final
energy is large and negative, the simulation will work just fine.

To appreciate the effect of the energy minimization, compare the potential
energy of the system and the maximum force at the first and last steps:

..  code-block:: bw

    (...)
    Step=    0, Dmax= 1.0e-02 nm, Epot= -2.29663e+03 Fmax= 1.07264e+04, atom= 29
    (...)
    Step=  533, Dmax= 1.3e-06 nm, Epot= -4.98327e+04 Fmax= 2.23955e+02, atom= 816
    (...)

As can be seen, the maximum force has been reduced by orders of magnitude,
down to :math:`224 ~ \text{kJ/mol/nm}` (about 0.4 pN). During the execution
of GROMACS, the following 7 files must have been created: **min.edr**,
**min.gro**, **min.log**, **min.mdp**, **min.top**, **min.tpr**, **min.trr**.

Let us visualize the trajectories of the atoms during the minimization step
using VMD by typing in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    vmd conf.gro min.trr

.. figure:: figures/solution-light.webp
    :alt: Gromacs tutorial : Movie showing the motion of the atoms during the energy minimization.
    :class: only-light

    :class: only-dark
    :height: 330

.. container:: figurelegend

    Figure: Movie showing the motion of the atoms during the energy minimization.

You can avoid having molecules and ions being cut by the periodic boundary
conditions by rewriting the trajectory using:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx trjconv -f min.trr -s min.tpr -o min_whole.trr -pbc whole

Then, select ``0`` as the group of your choice for the output, and reopen the
modified trajectory using VMD:

.. code-block:: bash

    vmd conf.gro min.trr

From the trajectory visualization, one can see that the molecules reorient
themselves into more energetically favorable positions, and that the distances
between the atoms are progressively homogenized.

Let us have a look at the evolution of the potential energy of the system. To
do so, we can use the ``gmx energy`` command of GROMACS. In the terminal, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx energy -f min.edr -o min-Ep.xvg

Choose ``potential`` by typing ``5`` (the number may differ in your case),
then press ``Enter`` twice.

Here, the portable energy file **min.edr** produced by GROMACS during the
minimization run is used, and the result is saved as a **.xvg** file named
**min-Ep.xvg**. **.xvg** files can be opened with the Grace software (or
equivalent) :cite:`grace`:

..  code-block:: bash

    xmgrace min-pe.xvg

One can see from the energy plot that the potential energy is initially close to 0,
which is the expected consequence of atoms being too close to one
another, as well as molecules being randomly oriented in space. As the
minimization progresses, the potential energy rapidly decreases and reaches
a large and negative value, which is usually the sign that the atoms are
located at appropriate distances from each other.

The system is now in a favorable state, and the molecular dynamics
simulation can be started.

Molecular dynamics (:math:`NVT`)
================================

Let us first perform a short (20 picoseconds)
equilibration in the :math:`NVT` ensemble. In the :math:`NVT` ensemble,
the number of atoms (:math:`N`) and the volume (:math:`V`) are maintained
fixed, and the temperature of the system (:math:`T`) is adjusted using
a thermostat.

Let us create a new input script called **nvt.mdp**, and save it in
the **inputs/** folder. Copy the following lines into it:

..  code-block:: bw

    integrator = md
    nsteps = 20000
    dt = 0.001

Here, the molecular dynamics (md) integrator is used, which is a leap-frog
algorithm integrating Newton equations of motion. A number of 20000 steps with
a timestep ``dt`` equal of :math:`0.001 ~ \text{ps}` will be performed.

Let us cancel the translational of the center of mass
of the system:

..  code-block:: bw

    comm_mode = linear
    comm_grps = system

Let us give an initial kick to the atom so that the initial
total velocities give the desired temperature of :math:`360~\text{K}`:

..  code-block:: bw

    gen-vel = yes
    gen-temp = 360

Let us also specify the neighbor searching parameters:

..  code-block:: bw

    cutoff-scheme = Verlet
    nstlist = 10
    ns_type = grid

Let us also ask GROMACS to print the trajectory in a compressed **.xtc** file
every 1000 steps, or every 1 ps, by adding the following line to **nvt.mdp**:

..  code-block:: bw

    nstlog = 100
    nstenergy = 100
    nstxout-compressed = 1000

Here, we also request gromacs to print thermodynamic information
in the log file and in the energy file **.edr** every 100 steps.

Let us impose the calculation of long-range
electrostatic, by the use of the long-range fast smooth particle-mesh ewald (SPME)
electrostatics with Fourier spacing of :math:`0.1~\text{nm}`, order
of 4, and cut-off of :math:`1~\text{nm}` :cite:`darden1993particle, essmann1995smooth`.
Let us also impose how the short-range van der Waals interactions
should be treated by GROMACS, as well as the cut-off ``rvdw`` of :math:`1~\text{nm}`:

..  code-block:: bw

    vdw-type = Cut-off
    rvdw = 1.0

    coulombtype = pme
    fourierspacing = 0.1
    pme-order = 4
    rcoulomb = 1.0

For this system, computing the long-range Coulomb interactions is necessary,
because electrostatic forces between charged particles decay slowly,
as the inverse of the square of the distance between them, :math:`1/r^2`.

Here, the cut-off *rcoulomb* separates the short-range interactions from the
long-range interactions. Long-range interactions are treated in the
reciprocal space, while short-range interactions are computed directly.

Let us use the LINCS algorithm to constrain the hydrogen
bonds :cite:`hess1997lincs`. The water
molecules will thus be treated as rigid, which is generally better given
the fast vibration of the hydrogen bonds.

..  code-block:: bw

    constraint-algorithm = lincs
    constraints = hbonds
    continuation = no

Let us also control the temperature throughout the
simulation using the so-called ``v-rescale`` thermostat, which is
a Berendsen thermostat with an additional stochastic term :cite:`bussi2007canonical`:

..  code-block:: bw

    tcoupl = v-rescale
    ld-seed = 48456
    tc-grps = Water non-Water
    tau-t = 0.5 0.5
    ref-t = 360 360

The ``v-rescale`` thermostat is known to give a proper canonical
ensemble. Here, we also specified that the thermostat is
applied to the entire system using the ``tc-grps`` option and that the
damping constant for the thermostat, ``tau-t``, is equal to 0.5 ps.

Here, two separate temperature baths for
the water molecules and the ions are used. Here, the ions are included
in the default GROMACS group called *non-water*.
Now, the same temperature :math:`T = 360 ~ \text{K}` is imposed to the
two groups with the same characteristic time :math:`\tau = 0.5 ~ \text{ps}`.

Note that the relatively high temperature of :math:`360~\text{K}`
has been chosen here to reduce the viscosity of the solution and
decrease the equilibration duration. 
    
We now have a minimalist input file for performing
the first :math:`NVT` simulation. Run it by typing in the terminal:

..  code-block:: bw

    gmx grompp -f inputs/nvt.mdp -c min.gro -o nvt -pp nvt -po nvt
    gmx mdrun -v -deffnm nvt

Here ``-c min.gro`` option ensures that the previously
minimized configuration is used as a starting point for the :math:`NVT` simulation.

After the completion of the simulation, we can
ensure that the system temperature indeed reached
the value of :math:`360~\text{K}` by using the energy command of
GROMACS. In the terminal, type:

..  code-block:: bw

    gmx energy -f nvt.edr -o nvt-T.xvg

and choose 10 for temperature, and then press enter twice.

From the generated **nvt-T.xvg** file, one can see that temperature
started from :math:`360~\text{K}`, as requested, then increase quicky 
due to the interaction between neighbor species. Thanks to the
thermostat that is removing the extra energy from the system,
the temperature reaches the requested temperature of
:math:`360~\text{K}` after a duration of a few picoseconds.

In general, it is better to perform a longer equilibration, but simulation
durations are kept as short as possible for these tutorials.

    during the :math:`NVT` molecular dynamics simulation.

Molecular dynamics (:math:`NpT`)
================================

Now that the temperature of the system is properly equilibrated,
let us continue the simulation in the
:math:`NpT` ensemble, where the pressure :math:`p` of the system
is imposed by a barostat and the volume of the box :math:`V` is
allowed to relax. During :math:`NpT` relaxation, the
density of the fluid should converge toward its equilibrium value.
Create a new input script, call it **npt.mdp**, and
copy the following lines into it:

..  code-block:: bw

    integrator = md
    nsteps = 80000
    dt = 0.001

    comm_mode = linear
    comm_grps = system

    cutoff-scheme = Verlet
    nstlist = 10
    ns_type = grid

    nstlog = 100
    nstenergy = 100
    nstxout-compressed = 1000

    vdw-type = Cut-off
    rvdw = 1.0

    coulombtype = pme
    fourierspacing = 0.1
    pme-order = 4
    rcoulomb = 1.0

    constraint-algorithm = lincs
    constraints = hbonds

    tcoupl = v-rescale
    ld-seed = 48456
    tc-grps = Water non-Water
    tau-t = 0.5 0.5
    ref-t = 360 360

So far, the differences with the previous :math:`NVT`
script are the duration of the run (the value of ``nsteps``),
and the removing of the ``gen-vel`` and ``gen-temp`` commands,
because the atoms already have a velocity.

Let us add an the isotropic C-rescale pressure
coupling with a target pressure of 1 bar :cite:`bernetti2020pressure`
by adding the following to **npt.mdp**:

..  code-block:: bw

    pcoupl = C-rescale
    Pcoupltype = isotropic
    tau_p = 1.0
    ref_p = 1.0
    compressibility = 4.5e-5
    
Run the :math:`NpT` equilibration using:

..  code-block:: bash 

    gmx grompp -f inputs/npt.mdp -c nvt.gro -o npt -pp npt -po npt
    gmx mdrun -v -deffnm npt

Let us have a look a the temperature, the pressure, and the
volume of the box during the NPT step using the ``gmx energy``
command 3 consecutive times:

..  code-block:: bash

    gmx energy -f npt.edr -o npt-T.xvg
    gmx energy -f npt.edr -o npt-p.xvg
    gmx energy -f npt.edr -o npt-rho.xvg

Choose respectively ``temperature`` (10), ``pressure`` (11) and
``density`` (16).

The results show that the temperature remains well controlled during the NPT
run, and that the fluid density was initially too small, i.e.,
:math:`\rho \approx 600\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^3`. Due to the change in
volume induced by the barostat, the fluid density gently reaches its equilibrium
value of about :math:`1000\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^3` after a few tens of
pico-seconds. Once the system has reached its equilibrium density, the
pressure stabilizes itself near the desired value of 1 bar.

The pressure curve reveals large oscillations in the pressure, with the
pressure alternating between large negative values and large positive values.
These large oscillations are typical in molecular dynamics and are not a
source of concern here.

Production run
==============

Let us perform a :math:`400~\text{ps}` run in the :math:`NVT` ensemble,
during which the atom positions will be printed every pico-second. The
trajectory will then be used to measure to probe the structure and dynamics
of the system.

Create a new input file within the **inputs/** folder, call
it **production.mdp**, and copy the following lines into it:

..  code-block:: bw 

    integrator = md
    nsteps = 400000
    dt = 0.001

    comm_mode = linear
    comm_grps = system

    cutoff-scheme = Verlet
    nstlist = 10
    ns_type = grid

    nstlog = 100
    nstenergy = 100
    nstxout-compressed = 1000

    vdw-type = Cut-off
    rvdw = 1.0

    coulombtype = pme
    fourierspacing = 0.1
    pme-order = 4
    rcoulomb = 1.0

    constraint-algorithm = lincs
    constraints = hbonds

    tcoupl = v-rescale
    ld-seed = 48456
    tc-grps = Water non-Water
    tau-t = 0.5 0.5
    ref_t = 360 360

All these commands have been seen in the previous part.
Run it with GROMACS starting from the system equilibrated
at equilibrium temperature and pressure, **npt.gro**, using:

..  code-block:: bash 

    gmx grompp -f inputs/production.mdp -c npt.gro -o production -pp production -po production
    gmx mdrun -v -deffnm production

Measurement
===========

After completing the simulation, we proceed to compute the radial distribution functions (rdf):

.. math::

   g(r) = \frac{V}{N_{\text{ref}} \rho} \frac{dN(r)}{dr},

where :math:`V` is the volume of the simulation box, :math:`N_{\text{ref}}` is
the number of reference atoms, :math:`\rho` is the average number density of
particles in the system, and :math:`\frac{dN(r)}{dr}` is the number of particles
in a spherical shell of thickness :math:`dr` around a reference particle at
a distance :math:`r`.

First, let us measure the rdf between :math:`\text{Na}^+`
ions and :math:`\text{H}_2\text{O}` molecules, as well as between :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}`
ions and :math:`\text{H}_2\text{O}`. This can be done using
the ``gmx rdf`` command as follows:
    
..  code-block:: bw 

    gmx rdf -f production.xtc -s production.tpr -o production-rdf-na-h2o.xvg

Then select the sodium ions as *reference* by typing 3, the water
as *selection* by typing 4, and press ``Ctrl+D``. The same can be done
for :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}` ions by typing:

..  code-block:: bw 

    ${gmx} rdf -f production.xtc -s production.tpr -o production-rdf-so4-h2o.xvg

and then by typing 2 and 4.

The results show...

    Figure: Radial distribution functions (RDF) as calculated between sodium
    and water (:math:`\text{Na}^+ - \text{H}_2\text{O}`), between sulfate and
    water (:math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-} - \text{H}_2\text{O}`).

The main issue with the calculated rdf, is that it includes all the atoms from 
thr :math:`\text{H}_2\text{O}` molecules (including the hydrogen atoms) and all
the atoms from the :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}`, leading to more peaks and dephts
and a more difficult analysis. Rdfs would be easiers to interpret, if only the 
water oxygen atoms (with name ``OW1``) and :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}` ions 
sulfur atoms (with name ``S1``) where included in the analysis. As these groups were not
included in the original group, we have to create them ourself.

To create groups, we can use the ``gmx make_ndx`` command as follow:

..  code-block:: bw 

    gmx make_ndx -f production.tpr << EOF
    a OW1
    a S1
    q
    EOF

And then type ``a OW1`` and press enter, ``a S1`` and press enter, and then
press ``q`` to save and quit. This will create a file name **index.ndx** that
contain two more groups (named OW1 and S1) alongside the default ones:

Then, let us rerun the ``gmx rdf`` command using the **index.ndx** file, and
selecting the newly created groups:

..  code-block:: bw 

    gmx rdf -f production.xtc -s production.tpr -o production-rdf-na-OW1.xvg -n index.ndx

and select 3 and 7.

..  code-block:: bw 

    gmx rdf -f production.xtc -s production.tpr -o production-rdf-so4-OW1.xvg -n index.ndx

and select 8 and 7.

The radial distribution functions highlight the typical distance between
the different species of the fluid. For instance, it can be seen that
there is a strong hydration layer of water around sodium ions at a typical
distance of :math:`2.4 ~ \text{Å}` from the center of the sodium ion.

..
    Mean square displacement
    ========================

    To probe the system dynamics, let us compute the mean square
    displacement for all 3 species.  For the sulfate ion, type:

    ..  code-block:: bash 

        gmx msd -f production.xtc -s production.tpr -o so4-msd.xvg

    Select the :math:`\text{SO}_4^{2-}` ions (in my case, it is done by typing
    *2*), and then press *ctrl D*. Repeat the same operation for the sodium
    ions and for the water molecules.

    The slope of the MSD in the limit of long times gives an estimate of the diffusion
    coefficient, following :math:`D = \text{MSD} / 2 d t`,
    where :math:`d = 3` is the dimension of the system. Here,
    I find a value of :math:`1.4 \mathrm{e}-5 ~ \text{cm}^2/\text{s}` for the
    diffusion coefficient of the sulfur ions. 
        
    Repeat the same for :math:`\text{Na}^+` and water. 

    For sodium, I find a value of :math:`1.6 \mathrm{e}-5 ~ \text{cm}^2/\text{s}`
    for the diffusion coefficient,
    and for water :math:`5.3 \mathrm{e}-5 ~ \text{cm}^2/\text{s}`.
    For comparison, the experimental diffusion coefficient of *pure* water at 
    temperature :math:`T = 360~\text{K}`
    is :math:`7.3 \mathrm{e}-5 ~ \text{cm}^2/\text{s}` :cite:`simpson1958diffusion`.
    In the presence of ions, the diffusion coefficient of water is expected to
    be reduced.
