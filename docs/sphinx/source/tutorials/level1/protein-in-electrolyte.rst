    Simulating a solvated protein

.. container:: justify

    The goal of this tutorial is to use GROMACS and perform a simple
    molecular dynamics simulation of a protein solvated in an electrolyte. The
    protein will be downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) :cite:`bank1971protein`
    and solvated in an electrolyte.

Convert the pdb file
====================

.. container:: justify

    Download the *.pdb* file from the |ProteinDataBank|,
    or simply click |1cta.pdb|. The protein is a calcium-binding peptide from site III
    of chicken troponin-C that has been determined using 1H-NMR
    spectroscopy :cite:`shaw1992determination`.

.. container:: justify

    We first need to create the *.gro* file, i.e. a GROMACS structure file,
    from the *.pdb* file. This can be done using *gmx trjconv*:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx trjconv -f 1cta.pdb -s 1cta.pdb -o 1cta.gro -center -box 5 5 5

.. container:: justify

    Choose the group *System* for the centering, and the group *System* as well 
    for the output. A file named *1cta.gro* is created. The generated *.gro*
    file contains 666 atoms, each atom corresponding to one line:

.. code-block:: bw

    TROPONIN C SITE III - SITE III HOMODIMER
    666
        0ACE      C    1   2.662   4.131   2.701
        0ACE      O    2   2.714   4.036   2.646
        0ACE    CH3    3   2.651   4.147   2.853
    (...)
    35NH2    HN2  664   2.417   3.671   3.192
    69CA      CA  665   3.016   2.279   1.785
    70CA      CA  666   1.859   2.046   1.838
    5.00000   5.00000   5.00000

.. container:: justify

    The last line is the box dimensions in nanometer, which was requested 
    in the *gmx trjconv* command by the *-box 5 5 5* option. All the options
    of *trjconv* can be found in the corresponding page of the GROMACS
    |trjconv-documentation|.

Choose the force field
======================

.. container:: justify

    Let us select the force field that will control the interactions between
    the different atoms. This can be done using the *gmx pdb2gmx* command:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx pdb2gmx -f 1cta.gro -water spce -v -ignh -o unsolvated.gro

.. container:: justify

    Here, the *-ignh* command is used to ignore the hydrogen atoms that are in
    the coordinate file and avoid an error, and *-water spce* is used to
    specify that the water model to use is the extended simple point charge
    model (spce) :cite:`berendsen1987missing`. 

.. container:: justify

    When running *gmx pdb2gmx*, choose the *AMBER03 protein, nucleic
    AMBER94* force field :cite:`duan2003point`. A new *gro* file named
    *unsolvated.gro* was created, as well as a topology *.top* file named
    *topol.top*.

Solvate the protein
===================

.. container:: justify

    The protein is now ready to be solvated. Let us first immerse it in pure
    water using *gmx solvate*:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx solvate -cs spc216.gro -cp unsolvated.gro -o solvated.gro -p topol.top

.. container:: justify

    Here, *spc216.gro* is a pre-equilibrated water configuration that is provided
    by GROMACS. After running *gmx solvate*, a number :math:`N = 3719` of
    water molecules, or SOL (for solvent), is created in the new GRO file
    named *solvated.gro* next to the protein. The number :math:`N` may slightly
    differ in your case. A new line must also appear at the end of the
    *topol.top* file:

.. code-block:: bash

    (...)
    [ molecules ]
    ; Compound        #mols
    Protein             1
    SOL              3719

Run an energy minimization
==========================

.. container:: justify

    Although *gmx solvate* creates molecules such as no overlap occur with the
    protein, it is safer to perform a short energy minimization to ensure that
    the distances between the atoms are reasonable.

.. container:: justify

    To do so, create a new folder named *inputs/*, and create a file named 
    *mininimize.mdp* into it. Copy the following lines into *mininimize.mdp*:

.. code-block:: bw

    integrator = steep
    nsteps = 50

    nstxout = 10

    cutoff-scheme = Verlet
    nstlist = 10
    ns_type = grid

    couple-intramol = yes

    vdw-type = Cut-off
    rvdw = 1.0

    coulombtype = pme
    fourierspacing = 0.1
    pme-order = 4
    rcoulomb = 1.0

.. container:: justify

    Here, the speepest-descent method is used, with a maximum number of steps
    of 50 :cite:`debye1909naherungsformeln`. The trajectory is printed every 10
    step, as specified by the *nstxout* option. The other commands control the
    interactions and cut-offs. 

.. container:: justify

    Prepare the energy minimization using *gmx grompp*:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx grompp -f inputs/mininimize.mdp -c solvated.gro -p topol.top -o min -pp min -po min -maxwarn 1
    gmx mdrun -v -deffnm min

.. container:: justify

    The *-maxwarn 1* is required here, because the system is not charge neutral
    and GROMACS will return a WARNING. The charge neutrality will be enforced
    later on. Finally, run the simulation using *gmx mdrun*:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx mdrun -v -deffnm min

.. container:: justify

    Thanks to the speepest-descent algoritm, the potential energy of the
    system decreases rapidly and becomes large and negative, which is usually
    a good sign. The potential energy can be extracted using *gmx energy*:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx energy -f min.edr -o potential-energy-minimization.xvg

.. container:: justify

    and choose *Potential*. The generated *.xvg* files contains the value of the
    potential energy (in kJ/mol) as a function of the simulation steps. The potential 
    energy decreases from :math:`-3 \mathrm{e}-4~\text{kJ}/\text{mol}` to
    :math:`-1.8 \mathrm{e}-5~\text{kJ}/\text{mol}`.

.. container:: justify

    The system can be visualized using VMD:

.. code-block:: bash

    vmd min.gro min.trr

Add the salt
============

.. container:: justify

    Let us add some ions to the system so that the (1) total charge is 0, and (2)
    that the salt concentration is :math:`c_\text{s} \approx 1~\text{mol/L}`.
    This is done using the *gmx genion* command, 

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx genion -s min.tpr -p topol.top -conc 1 -neutral -o salted.gro

.. container:: justify

    Select the group *SOL* as the continuous group of solvent molecules. GROMACS
    will replace some of the *SOL* residue by ions.

.. container:: justify

    As can be seen from the *topol.top* file, some sodium (Na+) and chloride
    (Cl-) ions were added, and the number :math:`N` of water molecules is 
    reduced compared to the previous step:

.. code-block:: bash

    [ molecules ]
    ; Compound        #mols
    Protein             1
    SOL         3563
    NA               81
    CL               75

.. container:: justify

    Out of safety, let us run a new energy minimization staring from the 
    *salted.gro* configuration. The *-maxwarn* option is not necessary
    as the system is charge-neutral.

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx grompp -f inputs/mininimize.mdp -c salted.gro -p topol.top -o min-s -pp min-s -po min-s
    gmx mdrun -v -deffnm min-s

.. container:: justify

    As previously, one can have a look at the potential energy using *gmx energy*:

.. code-block:: bash

    gmx energy -f min-s.edr -o potential-energy-minimization-s.xvg

Run the molecular dynamics
==========================

.. container:: justify

    Create a new input file called *nvt.mdp* and placed into the *inputs/*
    folder, and copy the following lines into it:

.. code-block:: bash

    integrator = md
    nsteps = 20000
    dt = 0.001

    comm_mode = linear
    comm_grps = system

    gen-vel = yes
    gen-temp = 300

    cutoff-scheme = Verlet
    nstlist = 10
    ns_type = grid

    nstxout-compressed = 1000

    vdw-type = Cut-off
    rvdw = 1.0

    couple-intramol = yes

    coulombtype = pme
    fourierspacing = 0.1
    pme-order = 4
    rcoulomb = 1.0

    constraint-algorithm = lincs
    constraints = hbonds

    tcoupl = v-rescale
    ld-seed = 48456
    tc-grps = system
    tau-t = 0.5
    ref-t = 300

.. container:: justify

    Here, the *v-rescale* thermostat is used to impose a temperature
    of :math:`T = 300~\text{K}`
    with a characteristic time of :math:`0.5~\text{ps}`.
    The *v-rescale* thermostat
    corresponds to the Berendsen thermostat with an additional stochastic
    term :cite:`bussi2007canonical`, and is known to give proper canonical ensemble.

.. container:: justify

    The *LINCS* algorithm is used to constrain the hydrogen bonds, allowing us 
    to use a timestep of :math:`1~\text{fs}`. Without such constraint, the fast
    vibration of the hydrogen bonds would impose the use of a smaller timestep,
    which make the computation more computationally expensive.
