    Simulating a protein in an electrolyte

.. container:: justify

    The goal of this tutorial is to use GROMACS and perform a simple
    molecular dynamics simulation of a protein solvated in an electrolyte. The
    protein will be downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) :cite:`bank1971protein`.
