                            open-source code GROMACS to perform
                            a simple molecular dynamics simulation: a liquid solution of water mixed with
                            sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) ions.
                            This tutorial illustrates several major ingredients of
                            molecular dynamics simulations, such as energy minimization, thermostating,
                            NVT and NPT equilibration,
                            and trajectory visualisation.

                        <p>
                            GROMACS must be installed on your machine. You can install it
                            following the instructions of the
                            <a href="https://manual.gromacs.org/current/index.html" target="_blank"
                            class="removelinkdefault">GROMACS website</a>. Alternatively,
                            if you are using Ubuntu OS, you can simply execute the
                            following command in a terminal:
                            <pre><code>sudo apt-get install gromacs</code></pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If GROMACS is indeed installed on you computer, 
                            typing the following command in the terminal :
                            <pre><code>gmx</code></pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            returns the version of GROMACS that has been
                            installed (on the top), I see:
                            <pre><code>:-) GROMACS - gmx, 2021.4 (-:</code></pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            as well as a quote (at the bottom), such as 
                            <pre><code>GROMACS reminds you: "Computers are like humans - they do everything except think." (John von Neumann)</code></pre>

                            In addition to GROMACS, you will need the 3 following tools:

                    <section id="minimization">
                        <h2>Energy minimization</h2>
                        <p>  
                            It is clear from the current conf file (see the previous image) that the atoms are currently in a 
                            quite unphysical configuration. It would be risky to directly perform a molecular dynamics simulation:
                            atoms would undergo huge forces and the system would explode. 
                            <br><br>
                            In order to bring the system into a favorable state, let us perform an energy minimization 
                            which consists in moving the atoms until the forces between them are reasonable. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Open a blank file, call it min.mdp, and save it in the 'inputs/' folder. Copy the following 
                            lines into min.mdp: 
                            <pre><code>integrator = steep
nsteps = 5000</code></pre> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These commands specify to GROMACS that the algorithm to be used is the speepest-descent, which move 
                            the atoms following the direction of the largest forces until 1 stopping criterial is reached. 
                            Then we specify the maximum number of steps to perform.<br><br>
                            In addition, we would like to be able to visualize the trajectory of the atoms during the 
                            minimization, so let us add the following command to the input file in order to 
                            print the atoms positions every 10 steps:
                            <pre><code>nstxout = 10</code></pre> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We now have a very minimalist input script, let us try it.
                            From the terminal, type:
                            <pre><code>gmx grompp -f inputs/min.mdp -c conf.gro -p topol.top -o min -pp min -po min
gmx mdrun -v -deffnm min</code></pre> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first command (grompp) is used to preprocess the files in order to prepare the simulation. 
                            The grompp command also checks the validity of the files. Using the '-f', '-c', and '-p' keywords, 
                            we specify which input, configuration, and topology files must be used.
                            The other keywords '-o', '-pp', and '-po' are used to speficy the names of the 
                            output that will be produced during the run.
                            <br><br>
                            The second command (mdrun) calls the engine performing the computation from the 
                            preprocessed files (reconised thank to the -deffnm keyword). The '-v' option is here to 
                            enable verbose and have more information printed in the terminal.
                            <br><br>
                            If everything works, you should see something like :
                            <pre><code>Steepest Descents converged to machine precision in 824 steps,
but did not reach the requested Fmax < 10.
Potential Energy  = -6.8990930e+04
Maximum force     =  2.4094606e+02 on atom 1654
Norm of force     =  4.6640654e+01</code></pre> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The information printed in the terminal indicates us that energy 
                            minimization has been performed, even though the precision that was asked 
                            from the default parameters was not reached. We can ignore this message. 
                            The final potential energy is large and negative, and the 
                            maximum force is small: 240 kJ/mol/nm (about 0.4 pN). Everything seems alright. 
                            <br><br>
                            Let us visualize the atoms' trajectories during the minimization step using VMD by typing:
                            <pre><code>vmd conf.gro min.trr</code></pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is what I see:
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            <b>Note for VMD user:</b> You can avoid having molecules 'cut in half' by the periodic boundary conditions by rewriting the trajectory using 
                            'gmx trjconv -f min.trr -s min.tpr -o min_whole.trr -pbc whole' </p>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One can see that the molecules reorient themselves into more energetically favorable positions, and that 
                            the distances between the atoms are being progressively homogeneized. Let us have a look at the
                            evolution of the potential energy of the system. To do so, we can use the internal 'energy' command 
                            of GROMACS. In the 
                            terminal, type:  
                            <pre><code>gmx energy -f min.edr -o epotmin.xvg</code></pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            and choose 'potential'. Here the edr file produced by Gromacs during the last run is used, and the result is saved in 
                            the epotmin.xvg file.

                            <b>Observation:</b> One can see from the energy plot that the potential energy is initially huge and positive, 
                            which is the consequence of atoms being too close from one another, and to molecules being 
                            wrongly oriented. As the minimization progresses, the potential energy rapidly decreases and reaches a large and 
                            negative value, which is usually a good sign as it indicates that the atoms are now in an energetically favorable configuration.

                        <p>
                            Let us first perform a small (20 picoseconds) equilibration in the NVT ensemble. For this 
                            simulation, the number of atom (N) and
                            volume (V) are maintained fixed, and temperature (T) is adjusted using a thermostat. 
                            Let use write a new input
                            script called nvt.mdp, and save it in the 'inputs/' folder.  Copy the following lines into it:

                        <p>
                            Here the molecular dynamics (md) integrator is used (leapfrog algorithm), and a number of 20000
                            steps with timestep (dt) 0.001 ps is requested, so the total requested duration is 20 ps. 
                            Let us print the trajectory in a xtc file
                            every 1 ps by adding:

                            the v-rescale thermostat, which is the Berendsen thermostat with an additional stochastic term

                            Here we also specified that the thermostat is applied to the entire system (we could choose 
                            to apply it only to a certain group of atom, which we will do later), and that 
                            the damping constant for the thermostat is 0.5 ps.

                            We now have a minimalist input file for performing the NVT step. Type in the terminal:

                        <p>   
                            Where '-c min.gro' ensures that the previously minimized configuration is used as a starting point.
                            <br><br>
                            After the completion of the simulation, we can ensure that the system temperature 
                            indeed reached the value of 360 K by using the energy
                            command of GROMACS. Type:

                            From the generated file, we can see that temperature started from 0, which was expected since the atoms 
                            have no velocity during a minimization step, and reaches a temperature slightly larger than the requested 360 K after 
                            a duration of a few picoseconds:

                        <h2>Improved NVT</h2>
                        <p>
                            So far, a very few commands have been placed in the NVT input file, meaning that most of the 
                            instruction have been taken by GROMACS from the default parameters. You can find
                            what parameters were used during the last nvt run by opening the new nvt.mdp file 
                            that has been created (i.e. not the one in the 'inputs/' folder, but the one in the main folder).
                            <br><br>
                            Exploring this new nvt.mdp file shows us that, for instance, plain cut-off Coulomb interactions have been 
                            used: 
                            <pre><code>; Method for doing electrostatics
coulombtype = Cut-off</code></pre>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For this system, long range Coulomb interaction is a better choice.
                                We could also better thermostat the system by thermostating water and 
                                ions separately. 
                                <br><br>
                                Therefore, let us improve the NVT step by specifying more options in
                                the input file. 
                                <br><br>
                                First, in nvt.mdp, let us impose the use of the long-range Fast smooth Particle-Mesh 
                                Ewald (SPME) electrostatics with Fourier spacing of 0.1 nm, order of 4, and 
                                cut-off of 4:
                                <pre><code>coulombtype = pme
fourierspacing = 0.1
pme-order = 4
rcoulomb = 1.0</code></pre>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Note: </b> With PME, the cut-off specifies which interactions are treated with 
                                Fourier transforms.
                                <br><br>
                                Let us also specify the van der Waals interaction:
                                <pre><code>vdw-type = Cut-off
rvdw = 1.0</code></pre>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                as well as the constraint algorithm for the hydrogen bonds of the water molecules:
                                <pre><code>constraint-algorithm = lincs
constraints = hbonds
continuation = no</code></pre>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let us also perform separate temperature baths (for water and ions=non-water respectively) by replacing:
                                <pre><code>tcoupl = v-rescale

                                Let us also specify neighbor searching parameters:
                            <p>
                                <pre><code>cutoff-scheme = Verlet

                                give an initial kick to the atom (so that the initial total velocities give 
                                the desired temperature instead of 0):
                            <p>
                                <pre><code>gen-vel = yes

                                and let us remove center of mass translational velocity of the

                                Run the new version of the input script. One obvious difference with the 
                                previous (minimalist) NVT run is the temperature at the beginning of the 
                                run (orange curve). In addition, the final temperature is closer to the 
                                desired temperature.

                            Now that the system is properly equilibrated in the NVT ensemble, let us perform an equilibration in 
                            the NPT ensemble, where the pressure is imposed and the volume of the box is free to relax, so that 
                            the density of the fluid converges toward equilibrium. 
                            <br><br>
                            Create a new input script, call it 'npt.mdp', and copy the following lines in it:

                            The main difference with the previous NVT script, is the addition of the isotropic Berendsen pressure coupling with a 
                            target pressure of 1 bar. Another differences are the addition of the 'nstlog' and 'nstenergy' commands to 
                            control the frequency at which information are printed in the log file and in the energy file (edr),

                            Finally, the results show large oscillations of the pressure with time. These large oscillations are

                            of all 3 species (water and ions) will be measured. First, let us perform a longer run in 
                            the NVT ensemble. Create a new input file, call it 'pro.mdp' ('pro' is for 'production'), and

                            the value is 1.5e-5 cm<sup>2</sup>/s, and for water 5.2e-5 cm<sup>2</sup>/s (not too far from the

                        <p>
                        Using GROMACS internal commands (the same way we used 'gmx msd'), extract the 
                        radial distribution function between Na and SO4 ions. 
                        It should look like that:  
                        <!-- gmx rdf -f pro.xtc -s pro.tpr -o rdf_whole.xvg -> choose either 
                        system twice, or Na then SO4 -->
